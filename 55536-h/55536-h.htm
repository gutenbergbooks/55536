<h2 class="lsp">PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="r20" />

<p class="noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must
chiefly depend upon the zeal and ardour, by which
all who enter into its service are animated, and
consequently it is of the highest importance that any
measure calculated to excite the spirit of emulation,
by which alone great and gallant actions are achieved,
should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment
of this desirable object, than a full display of the
noble deeds with which the Military History of our
country abounds. To hold forth these bright
examples to the imitation of the youthful soldier,
and thus to incite him to emulate the meritorious
conduct of those who have preceded him in their
honourable career, are among the motives that have
given rise to the present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed,
announced in the "London Gazette," from whence
they are transferred into the public prints: the
achievements of our armies are thus made known at
the time of their occurrence, and receive the tribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
of praise and admiration to which they are entitled.
On extraordinary occasions, the Houses of Parliament
have been in the habit of conferring on the Commanders,
and the Officers and Troops acting under
their orders, expressions of approbation and of thanks
for their skill and bravery, and these testimonials,
confirmed by the high honour of their Sovereign's
Approbation, constitute the reward which the
soldier most highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice
(which appears to have long prevailed in some of
the Continental armies) for British Regiments to keep
regular records of their services and achievements.
Hence some difficulty has been experienced in obtaining,
particularly from the old Regiments, an authentic
account of their origin and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence
of His Majesty having been pleased to command,
that every Regiment shall in future keep a full and
ample record of its services at home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country
will henceforth derive information as to the difficulties
and privations which chequer the career of those who
embrace the military profession. In Great Britain,
where so large a number of persons are devoted to
the active concerns of agriculture, manufactures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
and commerce, and where these pursuits have, for so
long a period, been undisturbed by the <em>presence of
war</em>, which few other countries have escaped, comparatively
little is known of the vicissitudes of active
service, and of the casualties of climate, to which,
even during peace, the British Troops are exposed in
every part of the globe, with little or no interval of
repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which
the country derives from the industry and the enterprise
of the agriculturist and the trader, its happy
inhabitants may be supposed not often to reflect on
the perilous duties of the soldier and the sailor,&mdash;on
their sufferings,&mdash;and on the sacrifice of valuable
life, by which so many national benefits are obtained
and preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour,
and endurance, have shone conspicuously under great
and trying difficulties; and their character has been
established in Continental warfare by the irresistible
spirit with which they have effected debarkations in
spite of the most formidable opposition, and by the
gallantry and steadiness with which they have maintained
their advantages against superior numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
the gallant exertions of the Corps employed; but
the details of their services, and of acts of individual
bravery, can only be fully given in the Annals of the
various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication,
under His Majesty's special authority, by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>, Principal Clerk of the Adjutant-General's
Office; and while the perusal of them cannot
fail to be useful and interesting to military men
of every rank, it is considered that they will also
afford entertainment and information to the general
reader, particularly to those who may have served in
the Army, or who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who
have served, or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit
de Corps</i>&mdash;an attachment to every thing belonging
to their Regiment; to such persons a narrative of
the services of their own Corps cannot fail to prove
interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions of
the great,&mdash;the valiant,&mdash;the loyal, have always been
of paramount interest with a brave and civilized
people. Great Britain has produced a race of heroes
who, in moments of danger and terror, have stood,
"firm as the rocks of their native shore;" and when
half the World has been arrayed against them, they
have fought the battles of their Country with unshaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,&mdash;victories so complete and surprising,
gained by our countrymen,&mdash;our brothers,&mdash;our
fellow-citizens in arms,&mdash;a record which revives
the memory of the brave, and brings their gallant deeds
before us, will certainly prove acceptable to the public.</p>

<p>Biographical memoirs of the Colonels and other
distinguished Officers, will be introduced in the
Records of their respective Regiments, and the
Honorary Distinctions which have, from time to
time, been conferred upon each Regiment, as testifying
the value and importance of its services, will be
faithfully set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record
of each Regiment will be printed in a distinct number,
so that when the whole shall be completed, the
Parts may be bound up in numerical succession.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<hr class="r20" />

<p class="noindent">The ancient Armies of England were composed
of Horse and Foot; but the feudal troops established
by William the Conqueror in 1086, consisted
almost entirely of Horse. Under the feudal
system, every holder of land amounting to what
was termed a "knight's fee," was required to
provide a charger, a coat of mail, a helmet, a
shield, and a lance, and to serve the Crown a
period of forty days in each year at his own
expense; and the great landholders had to provide
armed men in proportion to the extent of
their estates; consequently the ranks of the feudal
Cavalry were completed with men of property,
and the vassals and tenants of the great barons,
who led their dependents to the field in person.</p>

<p>In the succeeding reigns the Cavalry of the
Army was composed of Knights (or men at arms)
and Hobiliers (or horsemen of inferior degree);
and the Infantry of spears and battle-axe men,
cross-bowmen, and archers. The Knights wore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
armour on every part of the body, and their
weapons were a lance, a sword, and a small
dagger. The Hobiliers were accoutred and armed
for the light and less important services of war,
and were not considered qualified for a charge in
line. Mounted Archers<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> were also introduced,
and the English nation eventually became pre-eminent
in the use of the bow.</p>

<p>About the time of Queen Mary the appellation
of "<em>Men at Arms</em>" was changed to that of "<em>Spears</em>
and <em>Launces</em>." The introduction of fire-arms ultimately
occasioned the lance to fall into disuse,
and the title of the Horsemen of the first degree
was changed to "<em>Cuirassiers</em>." The Cuirassiers
were armed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cap-à-pié</i>, and their weapons were a
sword with a straight narrow blade and sharp
point, and a pair of large pistols, called petronels;
and the Hobiliers carried carbines. The Infantry
carried pikes, matchlocks, and swords. The
introduction of fire-arms occasioned the formation
of Regiments armed and equipped as infantry,
but mounted on small horses for the sake of
expedition of movement, and these were styled
"<em>Dragoons</em>;" a small portion of the military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
force of the kingdom, however, consisted of this
description of troops.</p>

<p>The formation of the present Army commenced
after the Restoration in 1660, with the establishment
of regular corps of Horse and Foot; the
Horsemen were cuirassiers, but only wore armour
on the head and body; and the Foot were pikemen
and musketeers. The arms which each
description of force carried, are described in the
following extract from the "Regulations of King
Charles II.," dated 5th May, 1663:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Each Horseman to have for his defensive
armes, back, breast, and pot; and for his offensive
armes, a sword, and a case of pistolls, the
barrels whereof are not to be und<sup>r</sup>. foorteen
inches in length; and each Trooper of Our
Guards to have a carbine besides the aforesaid
armes. And the Foote to have each souldier a
sword, and each pikeman a pike of 16 foote
long and not und<sup>r</sup>.; and each musqueteer a
musquet with a collar of bandaliers, the barrell
of which musquet to be about foor foote long,
and to conteine a bullet, foorteen of which shall
weigh a pound weight<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>."</p>
</div>

<p>The ranks of the Troops of Horse were at this
period composed of men of some property&mdash;generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
the sons of substantial yeomen: the young
men received as recruits provided their own horses,
and they were placed on a rate of pay sufficient
to give them a respectable station in society.</p>

<p>On the breaking out of the war with Holland
in the spring of 1672, a Regiment of Dragoons
was raised<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>; the Dragoons were placed on a lower
rate of pay than the Horse, and the Regiment
was armed similar to the Infantry, excepting that
a limited number of the men carried halberds
instead of pikes, and the others muskets and bayonets;
and a few men in each troop had pistols;
as appears by a warrant dated the 2nd of April,
1672, of which the following is an extract:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Charles R.</span></p>

<p class="in3">"Our will and pleasure is, that a Regiment
of Dragoones which we have established
and ordered to be raised, in twelve Troopes of
fourscore in each beside officers, who are to be
under the command of Our most deare and most
intirely beloved Cousin Prince Rupert, shall
be armed out of Our stoares remaining within
Our office of the Ordinance, as followeth; that
is to say, three corporalls, two serjeants, the
gentlemen at armes, and twelve souldiers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
each of the said twelve Troopes, are to have and
carry each of them one halbard, and one case
of pistolls with holsters; and the rest of the
souldiers of the several Troopes aforesaid, are
to have and to carry each of them one match-locke
musquet, with a collar of bandaliers, and
also to have and to carry one bayonet<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, or great
knive. That each lieutenant have and carry
one partizan; and that two drums be delivered
out for each Troope of the said Regiment<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>."</p>
</div>

<p>Several regiments of Horse and Dragoons
were raised in the first year of the reign of King
James II.; and the horsemen carried a short carbine<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
in addition to the sword and pair of pistols:
and in a Regulation dated the 21st of February,
1687, the arms of the Dragoons at that period
were commanded to be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Dragoons to have snaphanse musquets,
strapt, with bright barrels of three foote eight
inches long, cartouch-boxes, bayonetts, granado
pouches, buckets, and hammer-hatchetts."</p>
</div>

<p>After several years' experience, little advantage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>was found to accrue from having Cavalry Regiments
formed almost exclusively for engaging the
enemy on foot; and, the Horse having laid aside
their armour, the arms and equipment of Horse
and Dragoons were so nearly assimilated, that
there remained little distinction besides the name
and rate of pay. The introduction of improvements
into the mounting, arming, and equipment
of Dragoons rendered them competent to the
performance of every description of service required
of Cavalry; and, while the long musket
and bayonet were retained, to enable them to act
as Infantry, if necessary, they were found to be
equally efficient, and of equal value to the nation,
as Cavalry, with the Regiments of Horse.</p>

<p>In the several augmentations made to the
regular Army after the early part of the reign of
Queen Anne, no new Regiments of Horse were
raised for permanent service; and in 1746 King
George II. reduced three of the old Regiments
of Horse to the quality and pay of Dragoons; at
the same time, His Majesty gave them the title of
First, Second, and Third Regiments of <em>Dragoon
Guards</em>: and in 1788 the same alteration was
made in the remaining four Regiments of Horse,
which then became the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and
Seventh Regiments of <em>Dragoon Guards</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span></p>

<p>At present there are only three Regiments
which are styled <em>Horse</em> in the British Army,
namely, the two Regiments of Life Guards, and
the Royal Regiment of Horse Guards, to whom
cuirasses have recently been restored. The other
Cavalry Regiments consist of Dragoon Guards,
Heavy and Light Dragoons, Hussars, and Lancers;
and although the long musket and bayonet
have been laid aside by the whole of the Cavalry,
and the Regiments are armed and equipped on
the principle of the old Horse (excepting the
cuirass), they continue to be styled Dragoons.</p>

<p>The old Regiments of Horse formed a highly
respectable and efficient portion of the Army,
and it is found, on perusing the histories of the
various campaigns in which they have been engaged,
that they have, on all occasions, maintained
a high character for steadiness and discipline as
well as for bravery in action. They were formerly
mounted on horses of superior weight and physical
power, and few troops could withstand a
well-directed charge of the celebrated British
Horse. The records of these corps embrace a
period of 150 years&mdash;a period eventful in history,
and abounding in instances of heroism displayed
by the British troops when danger has threatened
the nation,&mdash;a period in which these Regiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
have numbered in their ranks men of loyalty,
valour, and good conduct, worthy of imitation.</p>

<p>Since the Regiments of Horse were formed
into Dragoon Guards, additional improvements
have been introduced into the constitution of the
several corps; and the superior description of
horses now bred in the United Kingdom, enables
the commanding officers to remount their regiments
with such excellent horses, that, whilst
sufficient weight has been retained for a powerful
charge in line, a lightness has been acquired, which
renders them available for every description of
service incident to modern warfare.</p>

<p>The orderly conduct of these Regiments in
quarters has gained the confidence and esteem of
the respectable inhabitants of the various parts of
the United Kingdom in which they have been
stationed; their promptitude and alacrity in attending
to the requisitions of the magistrates in
periods of excitement, and the temper, patience,
and forbearance which they have evinced when
subjected to great provocation, insult, and violence
from the misguided populace, prove the value of
these troops to the Crown, and to the Government
of the country, and justify the reliance which is
reposed on them.</p>

<p class="noindent">The circumstances under which the formation of
the <span class="smcap">Sixth, or the Inniskilling Regiment of
Dragoons</span>, took place, derived their origin from
the political events of the reign of King James II.,
and from the diversity of religious sentiments
entertained by His Majesty's subjects in Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1172<br />1370<br />1534<br />1660<br />1684</div>

<p>In the twelfth century (1172) Ireland, which
had been divided into a number of independent
states, of which Munster, Leinster, Meath, Ulster,
and Connaught were principal sovereignties, submitted
to the authority of the English monarch
Henry II. The religion of the people was the
Roman Catholic, the same as generally prevailed
in other parts of Europe; but two centuries afterwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the introduction of the reformed religion
commenced (1370), and was completed in England
in 1534, in the reign of Henry VIII.; it, however,
made little progress in Ireland, where the majority
of the inhabitants continued Roman Catholics.
The English, having embraced the Protestant
religion, extended their reformed ecclesiastical
institutions to Ireland, where many Protestant
families fixed their residence and obtained possessions.
The differences in religion, unfortunately,
created hostile feelings between the English and
Irish; commotions occurred, and a military establishment
was found necessary. This consisted
of various numbers at different periods: after the
Restoration in 1660, the Army of Ireland was
composed of twenty troops of horse, a regiment
of foot guards, and seventy companies of foot;
which were formed into three regiments of cavalry
and eight of infantry, including the (Irish) foot
guards<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>, in 1684. In the following year King
James II. ascended the throne, and instead of
overlooking the nominal distinctions among his
subjects, and seeking to promote the welfare of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
all, he commenced his endeavours to re-establish
the Roman Catholic religion in the three kingdoms,
by the most arbitrary proceedings in Ireland.
Opposite views and interests were thus brought
into collision; evil passions were called forth,
which produced effects contrary to those designed,
and the results embroiled Ireland in intestine
war, and involved many families in misery. The
King also commenced arbitrary proceedings in
England, where a number of noblemen and
gentlemen of property and influence, united in
soliciting the Prince of Orange to come to England
with an army to aid them in opposing the measures
of the Court.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1688</div>

<p>In the autumn of 1688 the Prince of Orange
prepared an armament for England, when the
army in Ireland was augmented with men of the
Roman Catholic religion, who, not obtaining
regular pay, were permitted to seize on the property
of Protestants for subsistence: persecutions
were also commenced against the latter, and a
report was circulated of a design to massacre all
persons of the reformed religion, on a named day,
when many families fled to England, and others
prepared to defend themselves.</p>

<p>Appearing on the western coast of England,
as the supporter of civil and religious liberty, the
Prince of Orange landed his army on the 5th of
November; he was welcomed by the people,&mdash;joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
by many noblemen,&mdash;by officers of rank
and distinction, and by a number of soldiers, and
he advanced by triumphant marches to the capital,
where his arrival was celebrated with public rejoicings:
King James vacated the throne, and
escaped to France.</p>

<p>These events afforded the strongest encouragement
to the Protestants of Ireland to make a
bold resistance to the proceedings of their opponents,
and to join in the same <span class="smcap">Revolution</span> which
had secured the blessings of a constitutional
monarchy, and of religious liberty, for England.
The principles of self-defence stimulated them to
make a daring effort for the preservation of their
liberties, in the hope of being aided from England;
and from the opposition thus made to illegal
aggression, the <span class="smcap">Sixth, or the Inniskilling,
Regiment of Dragoons</span>, derived its origin.</p>

<p>The city of <span class="smcap">Londonderry</span>, so called in consequence
of a number of Londoners having
settled there in the reign of James I., was garrisoned
by Lord Montjoy's regiment, which had
many Protestants in it: this corps was ordered to
march towards Dublin, and the Earl of Antrim's
newly-raised corps, all Catholics, was expected to
be ready to take charge of the garrison; but
some delay occurring, a town guard was organised;
and when the Earl of Antrim's regiment approached,
it was refused admittance: the gates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of the city were closed on the 7th of December,
and the most determined resistance evinced by
the inhabitants, who were encouraged by David
Cairnes, Esq., of Knockmany, and other zealous
gentlemen.</p>

<p>About the same period the inhabitants of
<span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> refused to allow two companies of
Sir Thomas Newcomen's regiment to enter their
town. Thus two important places were preserved
from the power of the adherents of King
James, and a military force was organised for
their protection. Gustavus Hamilton, Esq., was
elected governor of Inniskilling, and colonel of
the troops of horse and companies of foot formed
there, and Thomas Lloyd, Esq., lieutenant-colonel.
Colonel Lundy was governor of Londonderry,
situate about fifty-five English miles from Inniskilling.
The Protestant inhabitants of the north
of Ireland enrolled themselves for their mutual
defence; but those who fell into the power of
the adherents of King James were deprived of
their arms and property, and treated with great
severity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1689</div>

<p>The early part of the year 1689 was spent in
active preparations for defence: a corps of horse,
another of dragoons, and eight battalions of foot
were formed, and applications were forwarded to
England for military stores.</p>

<p>In February, the Prince and Princess of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Orange were elevated to the throne, by the title
of King William and Queen Mary, and their
accession was proclaimed at Inniskilling on the
11th of March. On the following day King
James landed at Kinsale from France; he was
accompanied by five thousand French troops, and
made his public entry into Dublin on the 24th of
March, three days after the accession of William
and Mary had been proclaimed at Londonderry.</p>

<p>In the mean time several encounters had
taken place between the forces of King James
and the newly-raised Protestant corps in the
north of Ireland, in which many of the latter
were overpowered; but the Inniskilling men were
conspicuous for personal bravery, which they
evinced on several occasions, and by their valour
they preserved themselves from many of the
calamities which befel others. On the approach of
Lord Galmoy with a detachment of King James's
army, the country people, fearing a general massacre,
fled with their cattle and effects to Inniskilling.
King James's troops besieged <em>Crom
Castle</em>; but were driven from before the place
with loss; and a party of his dragoons was seized
at Armagh; a most gallant action was performed
by two troops of horse and three companies of
foot, under Mr. Matthew Anketill, by which
<em>Monaghan Castle</em> was preserved; and on the 12th
of March Lord Blayney defeated a body of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Irish at <em>Ardtray bridge</em>. The success was, however,
not always on one side: Captain Henry
Hunter and a band of armed Protestants were
surprised and destroyed, near Comber; and a
party of Inniskilling men were slaughtered on
the banks of the <em>Aughaclane</em>.</p>

<p>The army of King James advanced against
<em>Londonderry</em>, to which city the Protestants of
that part of the country fled as to their last
refuge, and they defended the place with heroic
gallantry against the numerous army by which
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'it was beseiged'">it was besieged</ins>.</p>

<p>Colonels Thomas Cunningham and Solomon
Richards arrived at Lough Foyle in the middle
of April, with their regiments, the ninth and
seventeenth foot, for the support of Derry; but
in consequence of the misrepresentations of the
governor, Colonel Lundy, who stated that there
was not provision in the town for more than ten
days, and that an army of 25,000 men was near
the gates, they returned to England. The governor
and town-council were desirous of surrendering;
but when King James approached the town with
his army, the garrison broke through all restraint&mdash;fired
on the besieging force, killed several men,
threatened to hang the governor and council for
tampering with the enemy, and declared their
resolution to defend the place to the last extremity.
The governor escaped in disguise; a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
council was chosen; and the Reverend George
Walker and Major Thomas Baker were nominated
joint-governors during the siege.</p>

<p>The attack made by the army of King James
having been repulsed, the town was invested on
the 20th of April. The garrison of <span class="smcap">Londonderry</span>
consisted of seven thousand untrained countrymen,
without engineers; the town was not well
fortified; twenty guns only were on the walls,
and not one of them well mounted; yet the city
was successfully defended, for more than three
months, against a formidable army, which proves
how much depends on bravery and resolution.
The garrison made several gallant sorties, and
inflicted severe loss on the besieging troops.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> men under Gustavus
Hamilton were not inactive. Lieutenant-Colonel
Lloyd made a successful incursion into
the enemy's quarters, took and burnt the fortifications
of <em>Augher</em>, and returned to Inniskilling
with an immense number of cattle. The same
officer routed a body of King James's troops at
<em>Belleek</em>, killing a hundred soldiers, taking thirty
prisoners, and capturing two guns; and he threw
a relief into Ballyshannon on the 8th of May,
without the loss of a man, which proved a brilliant
commencement of aggressive warfare: he
also captured the enemy's garrison at Redhill,
and the castle of <em>Ballynecarreg</em>, in the county of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Cavan; and Captains Francis Gore and Arnold
Crosbie brought off two hundred troop horses
from a pasture at <em>Omagh</em>, which mounted three
troops of Inniskilling men.</p>

<p>The garrison of Londonderry becoming distressed
for want of provisions, the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>
men advanced to its relief; but the approach of
a body of troops, under Major-General Sarsfield,
to besiege Ballyshannon, and of another, under
Colonel Sutherland, to Belturbet, with the view
of besieging the town of <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>, obliged
them to return and defend their own quarters.
The gallant Lieutenant-Colonel Lloyd was detached
against <em>Belturbet</em>, from whence Colonel
Sutherland fled, on the 15th of June, leaving a
detachment of dragoons to defend the church, who
surrendered, and the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> men gained
possession of a supply of ammunition and provisions,
eighty troop horses with accoutrements,
and seven hundred muskets, which enabled them
to equip themselves better than before, and to
add several new companies to their levies.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the garrison of Londonderry continued
to defend that fortress with sanguinary
perseverance, and few days passed without King
James's army sustaining severe loss from the
sallies of the resolute defenders of the place.
The want of provisions occasioned the loss of
many men from dysentery; and Governor Baker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
dying on the 30th of June, Colonel Mitchelburne
was elected joint-governor with the Reverend
Mr. Walker. The cruelties exercised on the
inhabitants of the neighbouring towns and villages,
to induce the garrison to surrender, stimulated
the men to resistance. Major-General
Kirke arrived on the 30th of June with two
regiments of foot (the second and eleventh), and
a supply of arms, ammunition and provisions, but
was prevented from approaching the town by
forts on the banks, and a boom across the river.
After waiting a few days, he landed on the island
of Inch, where he threw up entrenchments, and
being joined by a number of countrymen, he
formed the design of assembling a sufficient force
for relieving the town by land. On the 12th of
July he was visited on board his vessel by the
Reverend Andrew Hamilton, and Mr. John Rider,
who represented to him the state of affairs at
<span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>, and obtained a supply of arms,
ammunition, and eight field-pieces; also commissions
for a regiment of horse to be commanded
by Colonel William Wolseley,&mdash;a regiment of
dragoons of twelve troops, commanded by Colonel
James Wynne (afterwards the fifth, or Royal
Irish dragoons), and three regiments of foot, commanded
by Colonels Zachariah Tiffin (now twenty-seventh),
Gustavus Hamilton, and Thomas
Lloyd, with a troop of cavalry to be attached to
each battalion of infantry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Before these corps were embodied, King
James's generals, designing to crush the intrepid
<em>Inniskilling</em> bands at once, sent three bodies of
troops against them. Lieutenant-Colonel Lloyd,
by a forced march of twenty miles, surprised
one division, under Major-General Sarsfield, in
their camp by night, and although his opponents
were five times more numerous than his own
party he routed them with a dreadful slaughter.
The Duke of Berwick, advancing with the second
body of King James's army, destroyed two companies
of Inniskilling foot sent forward to secure
a pass, but when he came to the defences made
to cover the approach to the town, he did not
venture to attack them, but withdrew, and was
soon afterwards ordered to join the army before
Londonderry: he subsequently skirmished with a
body of men which Major-General Kirke had
landed at Rathmetan, but failed to dislodge
them.</p>

<p>The third division of King James's army
advancing against <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> was commanded
by Major-General Justin M'Carthy, who had
been created Viscount Mountcashel, and it was
more formidable than the other two; but the
<span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> men had become emboldened by
success, and they fearlessly advanced to meet
their more numerous antagonists. Their leading
column encountered and routed the Viscount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Mountcashel's advance-guard, between Linaskea
and Inniskilling on the 30th of July, slew two
hundred men, and took thirty prisoners. In the
afternoon of the same day, the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>
forces, amounting to about two thousand men,
under Colonel Wolseley, attacked the opposing
army, of very superior numbers, in a formidable
position at <em>Newton Butler</em>. By forcing their way
over numerous difficulties, and traversing a dangerous
bog, the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> men were enabled
to assail the front of the adverse host, and their
attack was made with so much audacity and
heroic ardour, that the opposing ranks were
panic-stricken, and fled in dismay. The gallant
<span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> men pursued at speed, and overtaking
their adversaries among the bogs and
loughs, slaughtered two thousand fugitives;
about five hundred were drowned in attempting
to escape across the deep waters, and nearly five
hundred more were taken prisoners, including
Viscount Mountcashel, and Colonel Anthony
Hamilton. This surprising victory was gained
with the loss of twenty men killed, and fifty
wounded. Among the trophies of the day were
one iron and seven brass guns, a number of
standards and colours, a quantity of military
stores, and the whole of the enemy's baggage.</p>

<p>Many of the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> men, who had
evinced great personal bravery, had not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
regimented, and <span class="smcap">Sir Albert Cunningham</span>, a
gentleman highly esteemed in the county, and
who had been deprived of the appointment of
Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance in Ireland,
by King James, for his adherence to the reformed
religion, was authorized to embody six hundred
men, into a regiment of dragoons of twelve
troops, of which he was appointed colonel; and
the corps, thus formed of the distinguished
champions for the institutions of their country,
having been retained in the service of the Crown
to the present period, now bears the title of
the <span class="smcap">Sixth, or the Inniskilling, Regiment of
Dragoons</span>.</p>

<p>While the most signal success attended the
gallant <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> men, the garrison of Londonderry
was distressed for want of provisions,
and on the day that the battle of Newton Butler
was fought, the ships Montjoy of Londonderry,
and Phœnix of Coleraine, convoyed by the Dartmouth
frigate, forced the boom under a heavy
fire from the banks of the river, and, after encountering
many difficulties, anchored at the ship-quay,
to the great joy and relief of the brave
defenders of the town. King James's generals
were so dispirited by this success, and the loss at
Newton Butler, that on the night of the 31st of
July they raised the siege, which had occupied
one hundred and five days, and retired, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
lost from eight to nine thousand men, and many
officers, in their fruitless attempt to reduce the city.</p>

<p>Thus terminated the siege of <span class="smcap">Londonderry</span>,
which from the circumstances of its commencement,
the sufferings endured during its progress,
and the determined conduct of its brave defenders,
ranks among the glorious achievements
recorded in the annals of war. Governor Walker
proceeded to England with an address, on the
occasion, to King William and Queen Mary, and
was received at Court with all the honour due to
his distinguished services.</p>

<p>In the mean time an army was raising in
England to aid in rescuing Ireland from the
power of King James, and was placed under the
orders of the veteran Marshal Frederick Duke
Schomberg, who arrived in Ireland in August, with
ten thousand men, and besieged Carrickfergus,
which surrendered before the end of the month.</p>

<p>Twelve troops of Wolseley's horse, six troops
of Wynne's (late fifth Royal Irish), and six of
<span class="smcap">Cunningham's</span> (now <span class="smcap">Sixth</span>) dragoons, Tiffin's
(now twenty-seventh) Inniskilling foot, and Mitchelburne's
Londonderry regiment (afterwards
disbanded), joined the army commanded by the
Duke Schomberg, and were employed in the
operations of the campaign. The <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>
troopers had made their name a terror to their
opponents, and were highly esteemed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
English army. Story, the historian of these
wars, states, 'I went three miles beyond the
camp, where I met the <em>Inniskilling</em> horse and
dragoons, whom the Duke had ordered to be an
advance-guard to his army. I wondered much
to see their horses and equipage, hearing before
what feats had been done by them. They were
three regiments in all, and most of the troopers
and dragoons had their waiting-men mounted
upon garrons (small horses); some of them had
holsters, and others their pistols hung at their
sword-belts.'</p>

<p>The same author adds, 'If these men had been
permitted to go on in their old forward way, it
is probable they would have saved the town of
Newry being burnt.'</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> cavalry performed several
feats of gallantry, on detached services, during
the period the army was at the unhealthy camp
at Dundalk; and subsequently returned to their
own country for winter quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1690</div>

<p>Previous to the 1st of January, 1690, the
Inniskilling cavalry had been considered more as
corps of mounted militia, or of yeomanry cavalry,
than as regular troops; but at that period the
Inniskilling and Londonderry forces were placed
on the establishment of the regular army. The
following is an extract from King William's
warrant on the occasion:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cunningham's Inniskilling</span> dragoons formed
part of the force with which Colonel Wolseley
captured the town of <em>Belturbet</em>, which was occupied
as a frontier garrison. The colonel having
afterwards learnt that his opponents were about
to assemble at <em>Cavan</em>, to attack his quarters,
left Belturbet on the evening of the 10th of
February, 1690, with three troops of horse,
two of the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons, and seven
hundred foot of Kirke's (now second), Wharton's
(now twelfth), Tiffin's (now twenty-seventh),
and proceeded by a circuitous route towards
Cavan, with the intention of surprising his opponents
in their quarters, before the arrival of
their expected reinforcements. Having passed
the river at midnight, at a ford two miles above
Ballyhaise,&mdash;the infantry on horseback behind
the troopers,&mdash;he moved quietly towards Cavan,
but met with obstructions which delayed his
march, and the day had dawned when he drew
near the town, when, to his great astonishment, he
saw upwards of three thousand men, commanded
by the Duke of Berwick, formed on a rising
ground to oppose him. The disparity of numbers
was great; but trusting to the innate valour of
his soldiers, he sent forward a hundred <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>
dragoons to commence the action. As
they advanced along a narrow lane, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
galled by the fire of musketry from behind the
hedges, charged by a body of cavalry, and driven
back; but a volley from the musketeers checked
the enemy, and the troops continued their
march. After deploying in front of the enemy,
a reserve was ordered to halt, and Colonel
Wolseley advanced with the remainder in order
of battle. As he ascended the position, the
enemy raised a loud shout and fired a volley; but
the balls passed over the heads of Wolseley's
men, who continued to advance until they arrived
within forty paces of their opponents, and then
opened a sharp fire with good effect. The infantry,
slinging their muskets, were about to
charge sword in hand, when, the smoke clearing
away, they discovered King James's infantry
flying to the fort in a panic, and the cavalry
galloping towards the town. Wolseley's men
rushed forward, and entering the town, found
stores of provisions, shoes, ammunition, and brass
money; the temptation being great, they commenced
plundering, when the enemy's infantry
sallied out of the fort, and resumed the fight.
Wolseley attacked them with his reserve, and the
soldiers hurrying out of the town, and joining
in the contest, their opponents were driven back
with the loss of three hundred men killed, and
about two hundred taken prisoners; the Duke of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Berwick narrowly escaped, having had his horse
killed under him.</p>

<p>Colonel Wolseley had about thirty men
killed. He observed, in his public despatch,
'Our men showed on this, as on former occasions,
a very great forwardness to engage the enemy,
notwithstanding the inequality of their numbers,
and gave new proofs of their courage and
bravery, particularly Major-General Kirke's
men<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.' After destroying the stores and ammunition
which they were unable to remove, the
detachment returned to its quarters; and the
enemy, having discovered the resolute character
of the troops in Belturbet, laid aside the design
of attacking them.</p>

<p>On the night of the 4th of March, a detachment
of <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> cavalry, with fifty men of
Colonel Erle's regiment, scoured the country to
the vicinity of Cavan; and on the following
morning attacked and carried a fortified post at
<em>Butler's bridge</em>, killing twenty men and taking
sixteen prisoners; then joining another detachment,
drove a body of the enemy from the houses
of Cavan, and completed the destruction of the
town.</p>

<p>Provisions becoming scarce at Belturbet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Colonel Wolseley sent out two hundred <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>
horse and dragoons, who scoured the
country beyond Cavan and captured a thousand
head of cattle. Returning with their booty, they
found four hundred of the enemy formed up at
the river to oppose their passage; undaunted by
superior numbers, the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> troopers
rushed, sword in hand, upon their antagonists,
and a few moments' conflict decided the fortune
of the day; forty of King James's soldiers lay
dead on the field, eight were taken prisoners,
and the remainder escaped; the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>
men proceeded with their booty to Belturbet.</p>

<p>On the 6th of April another detachment of
seven hundred men, from the regiments of Kirke,
Erle, and Groven's Danes, with a party of <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>
horse and dragoons, advanced from Belturbet
to the castle of <em>Killeshandra</em>, which they
besieged and captured after a slight resistance;
and in May a detachment of <span class="smcap">Cunningham's
Inniskilling</span> dragoons was engaged in the capture
of the castle of <em>Ballinacargy</em>. Thus these gallant
horsemen succeeded in every enterprise in which
they were engaged, their fame spread to distant
parts, and they were a terror to their adversaries.
They ventured on the most dangerous undertakings,
and a detachment scoured the country
to <em>Kells</em>, within twenty-seven miles of Dublin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and returned with a supply of cattle and provisions.</p>

<p>In June, King William arrived in Ireland,
accompanied by Prince George of Denmark, and
a number of noblemen; the eyes of all Europe
were fixed on that country, where two kings
were to contend for a crown on a public theatre,
and the singular spectacle was exhibited of two
princes (the Prince of Orange and the Prince of
Denmark) fighting against the father of their
wives (King James), and of a nephew at the head
of an army against his uncle; it was, however, a
contest between liberty and slavery,&mdash;between
constitutional freedom and despotism. King William
headed his army of English, Dutch, Brandenburgers,
Danes, and French; and King James
took up a position behind the river <em>Boyne</em>, with
his own forces, and six thousand French and
Swiss troops, furnished by Louis XIV.</p>

<p>On the 1st of July a general engagement took
place, when the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons had the
honour of distinguishing themselves under the
eye of their sovereign. On this occasion, the
right wing of the English army, under the Count
de Schomberg, and the centre under the Duke
Schomberg, had forced the passage of the river,
and were engaged, when King William drew his
sword, and placing himself at the head of four
troops of the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> cavalry, told them, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
having heard a great deal of their bravery, he had
no doubt of witnessing it, and he led them towards
the river, followed by several other corps of
cavalry and infantry. The four captains requested
His Majesty not to expose his person by crossing
the river within shot of the enemy, but his reply
was, "I will see you over." When in the middle
of the stream, a volley from a regiment of the
enemy's dragoons brought down one man, killed
Captain Blashford's horse, and one bullet struck
one of His Majesty's pistols<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. Arriving on the
opposite bank, the King threw off the bandage
from his shoulder, which had been wounded on
the preceding day, and brandishing his sword, led
the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> men, and other troops which
had passed the river with him, against a body of
King James's soldiers, three times more numerous
than themselves, who were advancing towards
him with fury. Intimidated by the dauntless
bearing of the soldiers with King William, the
enemy halted, faced about, and fled towards
Donore; and the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> cavalry rushed
forward, sword in hand, with great intrepidity.
The other corps which had followed His Majesty,
pursued the enemy as far as Donore, where they
were charged by superior numbers, and forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
back. The King again placed himself at the
head of the brave <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> soldiers, and while
leading them forward, sustained a volley of musketry,
from which several men and horses fell;
he then turned to his left to enable his men to
charge; this was mistaken for a signal for them
also to wheel to the left, and they fell back a short
distance; but quickly discovering their error,
they confronted their adversaries, and dashing
forward with distinguished gallantry, overthrew
the opposing ranks. The battle exhibited all the
horrors of civil war; English fought with English,
Irish with Irish, and French against French; at
the same time Dutch, Danes, Swiss, and Brandenburgers
were mingled in the fray,&mdash;the colours
and standards of various nations floating over the
scene of combat. The Duke of Berwick's horse
was killed, and he was trampled upon by the
combatants. King William was in the hottest of
the fight, encouraging his men, and the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>
dragoons were seen bravely contending
for the victory.</p>

<p>Scarcely had <span class="smcap">Sir Albert Cunningham's</span>
dragoons (now <span class="smcap">Sixth</span>) reformed their ranks after
the charge, when General de Ginkell, and a party
of Dutch dragoons, were seen retreating in disorder
along a narrow lane, followed by crowds
of the enemy, shouting and brandishing their
swords; part of the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
instantly dismounted, also a detachment of
Leveson's (now Third) dragoons, and throwing
themselves into an old house, and lining the
hedge of the lane, opened such a brisk fire, that
the pursuing Irish faced about and fled. The
cavalry returned to the charge; the adverse army
sustained a decisive overthrow, and fled from
the field. Story observes of this action, "Those
of our English forces that were engaged, and
had opportunity to show themselves, gave signal
demonstrations of their courage and bravery;
the <span class="smcap">Inniskilliners</span> and French (protestants
in King William's service), both horse and
foot, did good service; and the Dutch guards
deserve no small honour for their conduct on
that day<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>."</p>

<p>No return of the loss of the regiment on
this occasion has been met with; but at the
muster at Finglas, seven days after the battle, it
brought three hundred private dragoons into the
field, which is <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'nearly one huudred'">nearly one hundred</ins> less than the
establishment.</p>

<p>King James fled to Dublin, and immediately
afterwards embarked for France; and King
William, directing his march to the capital,
gained possession of that city without loss. After
this success, the <span class="smcap">Sixth</span> dragoons formed part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
a body of troops detached under Lieutenant-General
Douglas against <em>Athlone</em>. Arriving before
the town, a summons to surrender was sent to
the governor, the veteran Colonel Grace, who
fired a pistol at the messenger and declared his
determination to defend the place. Not having
artillery and ammunition sufficient to prosecute
the siege, the troops withdrew from before the
town, and rejoined the army.</p>

<p>The regiment was subsequently employed
before <em>Limerick</em>, which city was besieged by the
English army. On the 11th of August, as the
regiment lay encamped near Limerick, information
arrived of the destruction of the battering train
on its march to join the army by a numerous
body of Irish cavalry under Brigadier-General
Sarsfield (formerly an officer of the English life
guards); <span class="smcap">Sir Albert Cunningham</span> instantly
issued from the camp with two squadrons of his
dragoons, and dashing across the country, intercepted
one of the enemy's detachments, which he
charged with signal gallantry, slew one major,
one captain, and twenty men; but their main
body escaped.</p>

<p>When King William raised the siege of
Limerick and returned to England, <span class="smcap">Cunningham's</span>
dragoons were ordered into winter quarters; but
were suddenly recalled in consequence of Brigadier-General
Sarsfield having invested the castle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of <em>Birr</em>, in the King's County:&mdash;after the flight of
the enemy from before this post, they remained
encamped near Birr, while additional fortifications
were being raised, and subsequently went into
quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1691</div>

<p>In the month of May, 1691, several ships
arrived at Dublin from England with men and
provisions, and great diligence was used in preparing
for an early and vigorous campaign: the
<span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons took the field this summer,
and joined the army commanded by Lieutenant-General
de Ginkell, on the 6th of June, on its
march towards <em>Ballymore</em>, which place was captured
after a short resistance. <em>Athlone</em> was also
taken, and the army advanced against the French
and Irish forces under General St. Ruth, in
position near <em>Aghrim</em>, in the county of Galway,
about three miles beyond Ballinasloe.</p>

<p>Arriving in front of the enemy about mid-day
on the 12th of July, the English and Dutch regiments
of horse guards, and a squadron of <span class="smcap">Cunningham's</span>
dragoons, were sent forward to force the
enemy from a pass in the middle of a bog which
lay in front of the Irish army, in which service they
succeeded; and two hundred men of the regiment
drove the enemy from a ford on the right
of the opposing army in gallant style, and from
the pass of Urachree. St. Ruth sent forward
fresh troops, and the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
also supported, a considerable body of troops was
soon engaged at this point, and the enemy was
eventually driven back. The English generals
met, and after some deliberation, resolved on a
general engagement, and between four and five
in the afternoon the battle began. After several
hours' sharp fighting, in which the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>
men gave fresh proofs of their innate bravery and
contempt of danger, the adverse army sustained
a decisive overthrow, and was chased from the
field of battle until the darkness of the night and
a thick misty rain put an end to the pursuit.
During the action, the French general, St. Ruth,
was killed by a cannon ball, as he rode down
Kilcommoden hill, and his fall so dismayed King
James's army that it was soon thrown into confusion
and routed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cunningham's Inniskilling</span> dragoons had
one lieutenant, one cornet, and forty-one non-commissioned
officers and private soldiers killed;
one captain, one lieutenant, and twenty-seven
men wounded on this occasion.</p>

<p>After the victory at Aghrim, the army advanced
to <em>Galway</em>, and the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons
were employed before this fortress during the
siege, which was terminated on the 21st of July,
by the surrender of the place. The English
forces subsequently moved towards Limerick,
where the wreck of King James's army was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
assembled; but <span class="smcap">Sir Albert Cunningham</span> was
left with his regiment of dragoons in the county
of Galway.</p>

<p><em>Sligo</em> was subsequently invested by a circular
chain of posts at a distance from the town, and
one troop of the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons was
stationed at the abbey of Ashro, near Ballyshannon,
and the remainder at Loughrea, Hedford,
and Shrewl. The governor of Sligo, Sir Teague
O'Regan, proposed conditions for surrendering
the town; but afterwards receded, when a closer
blockade of the place was resolved upon.</p>

<p>At the same time <span class="smcap">Sir Albert Cunningham</span>
was directed to proceed with his regiment to
Castlebar, to join the Irish forces under Sir
Baldearg O'Donnel, who had agreed to abandon
the interests of King James, and to join the
English army with his brigade.</p>

<p>This Baldearg, or Balderick, O'Donnel, was
descended from one of the branches of the Tyrconnel
family; his ancestors having fled to Spain
after the rebellion of 1607, he was born and educated
in that country. The Irish, with their characteristic
superstition, cherished an idle prophecy,
that a descendant of that old family, who would
be distinguished by a red mark, as this man was,
would free their country from the English yoke.
The coincidence of his family and name,&mdash;Derg,
or Darg, signifying red, induced them to send for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
him from Spain, and he arrived at Limerick in
September, 1690, when thousands flocked to
him; but he disappointed their expectations, and
achieved nothing worthy of record. After the
battle of Aghrim, he was so alarmed, that he
kept, with his followers, in the mountains in the
county of Mayo for some time, and at length
tendered his submission to the government of
King William, and promised to bring a considerable
number of men over with him, for a stipulated
reward.</p>

<p>When the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons arrived at
Castlebar, O'Donnel's men were found in a state
of mutiny, many of them resolving to adhere to
the interest of King James; but the commotion
was eventually appeased, and they arrayed themselves
under King William's banners. On the
4th of September <span class="smcap">Sir Albert Cunningham</span> took
post with part of his regiment at <em>Coloony</em>, five
miles south of Sligo, intending to join O'Donnel
on the following day, and approach nearer the
besieged town. During the night seven hundred
select men of King James's army, commanded by
Colonel Scott, issued from Sligo, and, being favoured
by a foggy morning, surprised the detachment
of <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons in their camp
near Coloony, at day-break on the following
morning. The troopers finding themselves suddenly
assailed by superior numbers, mounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
their horses and galloped to Abbey Royle, in the
county of Roscommon. The enemy killed about
twenty men, took <span class="smcap">Sir Albert Cunningham</span> prisoner,
and captured the tents, cloaks, and baggage
belonging to the dragoons.</p>

<p>After the brave and humane <span class="smcap">Sir Albert
Cunningham</span> was made prisoner, an Irish serjeant
approached him and said, 'Albert is your
name, and by an H&mdash;albert you shall die,' and
instantly speared him on the spot. 'Thus fell
<span class="smcap">Sir Albert Cunningham</span>, as gallant and
worthy an officer as any in the King's service<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.'</p>

<p>Part of O'Donnel's brigade arriving on the
following day, the enemy was driven back into
Sligo, and all the baggage, &amp;c., was recaptured.</p>

<p>After the death of <span class="smcap">Sir Albert Cunningham</span>
the Regiment was commanded, until King William's
pleasure was made known, by the lieutenant-colonel,
<span class="smcap">Robert Echlin</span>.</p>

<p>A body of troops was assembled for the reduction
of <em>Sligo</em>, and placed under the orders of the
Earl of Granard, and Colonel Mitchelburne, to
whom this fortress was delivered up on the 13th
of September.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meantime the army commanded by
General De Ginkell had besieged <em>Limerick</em>, and
the surrender of that city, and of all other forts
and garrisons, in September, terminated the war
in Ireland; the champions of constitutional
liberty having triumphed over all opposition.</p>

<p>Thus the gallant <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> men, who composed
the <span class="smcap">Sixth</span> regiment of dragoons, had the
satisfaction of witnessing the deliverance of their
country from the continued effects of civil war,
and the blessings of peace once more diffusing
themselves over the land. They had purchased
these advantages with their swords, many of them
had toiled, and fought, and bled in the cause of
civil and religious liberty, and they had the proud
distinction of receiving the expressions of their
Sovereign's approbation and their country's gratitude.
King William also rewarded the services
of their lieutenant-colonel, <span class="smcap">Robert Echlin</span>, with
the colonelcy of the regiment, by commission
dated the 30th of December, 1691. The thanks
of Parliament were communicated to Lieutenant-General
De Ginkell, and the officers and soldiers
who served under his orders, and the lieutenant-general
was afterwards created <span class="smcap">Earl of Athlone</span>,
Viscount Aghrim, and Baron of Ballymore.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1692</div>

<p>Although the war in Ireland was terminated,
yet the known hostile spirit of a great portion of
the inhabitants to the established government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and the attempts made from time to time by
Louis XIV. to replace King James on the throne,
rendered the presence of a considerable number
of troops, in whom the utmost reliance could be
placed, necessary in that country; and <span class="smcap">Echlin's</span>
Inniskilling dragoons, having proved their attachment
and fidelity to King William, their devotion
to the principles of the Revolution, and their
usefulness in every description of service, were
employed in Ireland during the remainder of His
Majesty's reign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1694</div>

<p>The first of the two regiments of Inniskilling
dragoons, commanded by Colonel James Wynne,
served under King William in Flanders, and
obtained the title of '<span class="smcap">The Royal Irish Regiment
of Dragoons</span>;' Colonel <span class="smcap">Echlin's</span> regiment
received no change of designation; but has
retained its title of "<span class="smcap">Inniskilling Dragoons</span>" to
the present time; it was numbered the "<span class="smcap">Sixth
Dragoons</span>" in the reign of George II.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1702<br />1703</div>

<p>During the early part of the reign of Queen
Anne the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling Dragoons</span> remained in
Ireland; they were reviewed at Athlone, in July,
1703, by the lord-lieutenant, General the Duke
of Ormond, who was pleased to compliment the
commanding officer on their appearance and discipline.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1706</div>

<p>In the summer of 1706, the regiment was
encamped on the Kurragh of Kildare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1708</div>

<p>The King of France having made preparations,
in the spring of 1708, for landing the Pretender
with a body of troops in Scotland, to aid him in
his projected attempt to ascend the British throne,
the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons were held in readiness
to embark for Scotland; but the French fleet
having been chased from the British shores, the
regiment remained in Ireland until the following
autumn, when it landed on the English coast,
and was stationed, during the winter, in Yorkshire
and Lancashire.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1709<br />1710<br />1711<br />1712</div>

<p>The regiment was withdrawn from its cantonments
in the early part of 1709, and proceeded
to Scotland, where it remained during the three
following years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1713</div>

<p>Returning to England after the peace of
Utrecht, the regiment was stationed in Cumberland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1714</div>

<p>In September, 1714, the regiment again
occupied quarters in Scotland, and the officers,

(now Sixteenth foot), celebrated at Stirling the
arrival of King George I. from Hanover, with
public rejoicings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1715</div>

<p>Lieut.-General Echlin retired from the regiment
in March, 1715, and was succeeded by
<span class="smcap">John Earl of Stair</span>, who had been removed
from the Scots Greys, by Queen Anne's ministry,
in April of the preceding year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>The regiment was stationed in Lancashire in
the spring of 1715, and in June one squadron
was employed in suppressing riots at Manchester.
Soon afterwards the Regiment marched to Scotland,
and in the autumn, it was encamped at
Stirling, under Major-General Wightman.</p>

<p>Encouraged by promises of aid from the Continent,
the Earl of Mar raised the standard of
the Pretender in the Highlands, and assembled
an army of ten thousand men. The camp at
Stirling was afterwards augmented by additional
forces, and the Duke of Argyle assumed the
command; but the rebels exceeded in numbers
the king's troops.</p>

<p>Ten thousand rebels, headed by the Earl of
Mar, were on the march to cross the Forth and
penetrate towards England, when the Duke of
Argyle quitted the camp at Stirling, with a body
of troops of less than four thousand men, to
oppose the progress of the rebels, and on the
morning of Sunday the 13th of November the
two armies confronted each other on <em>Sheriffmuir</em>
near <em>Dumblain</em>. The Inniskilling dragoons
formed two strong squadrons; the first squadron
was posted, with the Royal North British (second)
and Evans' (fourth) dragoons, on the right of the
king's army; and the second squadron, with Carpenter's
(third) and Kerr's (seventh) dragoons,
was stationed on the left. The rebels attempting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
to turn the right, the dragoons on that flank
dashed forward sword in hand, and commenced
the action by a furious charge on the left wing
of the rebel army. A sharp conflict ensued; but
soon the clash of swords and report of pistols
ceased, and the insurgent bands were seen falling
back in confusion; while the Greys, Evans', and
<span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons, resolute men on powerful
horses, rode onward, sabring the astonished Highlanders,
who fled in dismay, and the Buffs (third
foot) and other infantry corps on the right,
followed the victorious dragoons in their triumphant
career. The rebels, having great superiority
of numbers, attempted to rally several
times; but the dragoons galloped forward with
admirable courage, and breaking through every
opposition, pursued their adversaries to the banks
of the river Allan, where they were ordered to
halt.</p>

<p>In the mean time the left wing of the King's
army had been defeated; six hundred Highlanders
surprised the infantry in the act of forming,
and put them into confusion; but Carpenter's,
Kerr's, and the squadron of <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons
on the left flank, charged and defeated the rebel
horsemen opposed to them, and captured a
standard. The infantry of this wing being in
disorder, the advantage gained by the dragoons
was not pursued any further. Both armies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
claimed the victory, each having a wing victorious
and a wing defeated; but the King's forces
succeeded in preventing the march of the rebels
southwards, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'and conseqently'">and consequently</ins> the advantage was
on the side of the Royal army.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons had seven men
and twelve horses killed; six men and fifteen
horses wounded. In some of the numerous
accounts of this battle which were published at
the time, the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons are styled
the <em>black dragoons</em>, from which it is presumed
they were mounted on black horses exclusively.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1716</div>

<p>Returning to Stirling with the army, the
<span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons resumed their former
station in the camp near that city, where they
remained until January, 1716, when, additional
forces having arrived, they advanced through
snow and over ice to Perth. The rebel army
dispersed, and the leaders in the rebellion fled
to France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1717</div>

<p>After the suppression of this commotion, the
regiment was quartered at Aberdeen, from whence
it marched southwards, and was stationed in
Cumberland; but returned to Scotland in June,
1717; and in the autumn of that year occupied
cantonments near Glasgow. At the same time
the establishment was fixed at six troops, of three
officers, one quarter-master, and forty-five non-commissioned
officers and soldiers each.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1718<br />1725<br />1726</div>

<p>The regiment appears to have passed the succeeding
ten years in Scotland. In July, 1725, it
was employed in <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'supppressing riots'">suppressing riots</ins> at Glasgow,
and was encamped near that city; and in October,
1726, the Greys and <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons were
reviewed in brigade at Musselburgh by Lieutenant-General
Wade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1728</div>

<p>Leaving Scotland in the spring of 1728, the
regiment proceeded to Carlisle, Penrith, and
Kendal, where it halted a week, and afterwards
continued its march southwards, and was quartered
in Berkshire. On the 3rd of June it was
reviewed on Datchet Common by King George
II., who expressed his approbation of its appearance
and discipline.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1729<br />1730<br />1731<br />1732</div>

<p>After the review the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons
marched back to Lancashire; in December their
quarters were extended to Northumberland; and
in March, 1729, they were ordered to return to
Scotland, where they passed the succeeding three
years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1733</div>

<p>In the spring of 1733, the regiment was
ordered to march for England, and in June
furnished detachments on coast duty in Essex, on
which service it was employed during the following
year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1734</div>

<p>The Earl of Stair having joined the opposition
against Sir Robert Walpole was removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
from the regiment, and was succeeded in the
colonelcy by Charles Lord Cadogan from the
Fourth foot, by commission dated the 19th of
June, 1734.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1735<br />1736<br />1737<br />1738</div>

<p>The regiment remained in the south of England,
and was employed on coast duty during the
years 1735 and 1736; in May, 1737, it marched
to Nottingham and Derby; and in April, 1738,
into Lincolnshire, and furnished detachments for
the prevention of smuggling along the coast.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1739</div>

<p>At this period the establishment was six
troops of three officers, one quarter-master, two
sergeants, three corporals, two drummers, one
hautboy, and forty-nine private men per troop;
but on the breaking out of the war with Spain,
in 1739, an augmentation of one sergeant and
ten men per troop was ordered, making a total
of four hundred and thirty-five officers and men,
including the staff.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1740</div>

<p>The regiment continued to occupy quarters
in Lincolnshire in 1740.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1741</div>

<p>In the summer of 1741, when the Elector of
Bavaria, aided by the French monarch, attempted
to deprive the Archduchess Maria Theresa, of
Hungary and Bohemia, the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons
were directed to hold themselves in readiness
to proceed on foreign service, and were
encamped on Lexden Heath, with six other regiments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>of cavalry and seven of infantry; but no
embarkation took place, and in the autumn they
went into quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1742</div>

<p>In 1742 King George II. sent sixteen thousand
men to Flanders, under Field-Marshal the
Earl of Stair, to support the interests of the
house of Austria; and the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons
were selected for this service. After landing at
Ostend, the regiment marched to Ghent, where
it was quartered several weeks, and subsequently
proceeded to Brussels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1743</div>

<p>From Brabant, the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons
marched, in the beginning of 1743, for Germany,
and in May they formed, with the Third dragoons,
three battalions of foot guards, and two regiments
of the line, a detached camp below the town of
Hochst.</p>

<p>While in Germany, the lieutenant-colonel,
<span class="smcap">James Gardiner</span>, was promoted to the colonelcy
of the Thirteenth dragoons<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.</p>

<p>Lord Cadogan, having been removed to the
second troop (now second regiment) of life guards,
was succeeded in the colonelcy by Field-marshal
the Earl of Stair, by commission dated the 25th
of April, 1743.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>In the early part of June the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>
dragoons crossed the Maine and encamped at
Aschaffenberg, where King George II. and His
Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland joined
the army.</p>

<p>Leaving Aschaffenberg on the morning of the
16th of June, the army moved in columns along
the banks of the Maine to join the Hanoverians
and Hessians at Hanau. The French
under Marshal Noailles crossed the river, and
taking up a formidable position between the
Maine and the mountains near <em>Dettingen</em>, prepared
to oppose the march of the allies: at the
same time the French commander seized the
bridge at Aschaffenberg, to cut off the retreat of
his opponents. These movements brought on a
general engagement, and the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons
had an opportunity of signalizing themselves
under the eye of their sovereign.</p>

<p>While the allied army was forming for battle,
the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons and other cavalry
covered the operation, and were exposed to the
enemy's cannon. The French household troops,
headed by the princes of the blood, became impatient
of inactivity, and quitting their advantageous
position, galloped forward to commence
the action. The British cavalry advanced to meet
their antagonists, and were repulsed; but a volley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
from the British infantry destroyed several French
squadrons, and the English troopers returning to
the charge, drove back their opponents. The
battle extended along the line, and the British,
Austrian, and Hanoverian infantry, fiercely encountering
the French battalions, gained advantage
after advantage, until the fortune of the day was
so evidently in their favour that the result was no
longer doubtful. Meanwhile the charges of the
cavalry were frequent and sanguinary. Bland's
(third) dragoons, and the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> troopers
charged and overpowered a superior body of
horse, then rushed sword in hand upon a line of
French cuirassiers, whose polished armour proved
ineffectual against the prowess and resolution of
the British dragoons fighting in the presence
of their King. The life-guards, blues, King's
horse (now first dragoon guards), and Ligonier's
troopers (now seventh dragoon guards), behaved
nobly; the royals and greys captured each a
standard<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>; and Rich's (fourth) and Cope's
(seventh) dragoons had their share in the combat.
Unable to withstand the fury of the charging
Britons, the French gave way, and were driven
across the Maine with such precipitation, that
many men were drowned in the river.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons returned from the
pursuit and bivouacked near the scene of conflict.
Their loss was two men and eighteen horses
killed; and one man and nine horses wounded.
On the following day they continued their march
to Hanau, where they were encamped until the beginning
of August, when they proceeded towards
the Rhine, and having passed that river, were
employed in West Germany; the King having
his head-quarters at the episcopal palace of
Worms, and afterwards at Spire. In October
His Majesty marched the army back to Mentz,
from whence the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons continued
their route to Flanders, where they passed
the winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1744</div>

<p>The regiment served the campaign of 1744
with the army commanded by Field-Marshal
Wade; and after encamping for some time behind
the Scheldt, was employed in an incursion into
the French territory, and in collecting contributions.
In October the regiment went into
winter quarters at Ghent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1745</div>

<p>Having been withdrawn from their cantonments
in April, 1745, the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons
encamped near Brussels, where they were reviewed
by the Duke of Cumberland, and subsequently
advanced with the army commanded by
His Royal Highness to attack the French, who
had commenced the siege of Tournay with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
immense body of troops under the command of
Marshal Saxe. One squadron of the regiment
formed part of the force which drove in the
enemy's out-guards, on the 28th of April (O.S.).</p>

<p>The French occupied a fortified camp, protected
by immense batteries, near the village of
<em>Fontenoy</em>; and the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons supported
the infantry in their attacks on this
formidable position; on which occasion the
English foot-guards, and several regiments of
the line, displayed signal valour and intrepidity,
and carried the enemy's trenches in gallant style;
but the Dutch having failed in their attempt on
the village of Fontenoy, and the French battery
in the wood of Barri not having been stormed
according to order, the troops, which had forced
the position, were unable to maintain their
ground. Towards the close of the action, the
cavalry was ordered forward, and several corps
charged with great spirit and resolution, but were
unable to retrieve the fortune of the day; and a
retreat having been ordered, the army withdrew
to Aeth. In this action the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons
evinced the same forward bearing and
firmness as on former occasions. Their loss was
Quarter-master Baird, three men, and nineteen
horses killed; eleven men and seven horses
wounded.</p>

<p>The army encamped on the plains of Lessines;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'while the INNISKILING'">while the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span></ins> dragoons were at
this camp, their Colonel, Field-Marshal the Earl
of Stair, was removed to the Scots greys, and
was succeeded by John Earl of Rothes, by commission
dated the 29th of May, 1745.</p>

<p>After the surrender of Fontenoy the French
army advanced, and having an immense superiority
of numbers, the allies withdrew, and took up a
position to cover Brussels. The <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>
dragoons encamped near Meerbeck, and subsequently
on the canal between Ghent and
Brussels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1746</div>

<p>Meanwhile a rebellion, headed by Charles
Edward, eldest son of the Pretender, had broken
out in Scotland, and many British regiments
were ordered to return home. The <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>
dragoons marched, during the winter, to Williamstadt,
in North Brabant, and towards the end of
February, 1746, embarked for England; but the
transports were driven by tempestuous weather
back into the harbour, and the troops disembarked.
The rebellion having been suppressed
shortly afterwards, the order for their return was
countermanded, and they went into quarters on
the frontiers of Holland.</p>

<p>Quitting their cantonments in the spring of
1746, the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons were employed
in the operations of the army commanded by
Lieutenant-General Sir John Ligonier. In May<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
they were encamped behind the Dyle: the French
having a great superiority of numbers, the allies
were forced to retire towards Antwerp; subsequently
to Breda; and many fortified towns were
captured by the enemy. In July, Prince Charles
of Lorraine took the command of the army, and
the British dragoons were employed in manœuvring
and skirmishing with the French cavalry,
in order to retard the operations of the adverse
army.</p>

<p>During the forenoon of the 1st of October
(O.S.), the allies were in position on the plain of
Liege; several villages were occupied by the
infantry, and the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons stood in
line on some open ground near the village of
<em>Roucoux</em>. About mid-day numerous columns of
the enemy appeared advancing under Marshal
Saxe; and being emboldened by their superior
numbers, their artillery opened a tremendous
cannonade, and about fifty battalions attacked
three villages on the left of the allied army with
great fury. Having carried the villages, the
French infantry diverged upon the open ground,
where the Greys, <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>, and Seventh
dragoons appeared in line, headed by the gallant
Earls of Rothes and Crawford. As the enemy
advanced in crowds, as if confident of success,
the three regiments dashed forward, overthrew
the opposing ranks, and chased the French musketeers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
to the hedges and thickets near the village
in gallant style. A retreat having been ordered,
the army withdrew across the river Maese, and
encamped near Maestricht.</p>

<p>The regiment was commended in orders for
its conduct on this occasion; it had three men
wounded: and six horses killed and seven
wounded: one horse fell into the hands of the
enemy.</p>

<p>After encamping a short time in the province
of Limburg, the regiment went into quarters in
the country along the Lower Maese.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1747</div>

<p>During the campaign of 1747 the allied army
was commanded by the Duke of Cumberland;
and after encamping a short time near the banks
of the Scheldt, the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons were
employed in operations on the Great Nethe, and
on the Demer. The 1st of July was passed in
skirmishing near the frontiers of Liege; the two
armies confronted each other, and on the following
day a sharp action was fought, on which occasion
the regiment acquired new laurels.</p>

<p>Under the cover of a heavy cannonade, the
French infantry attacked the village of <em>Val</em>,
which was occupied by four battalions (three
British and one Hanoverian), and the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>
dragoons were formed behind the houses.
Eventually the village was captured, and the
enemy broke the centre of the allied army. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
cavalry of the left wing was led forward by Sir
John Ligonier, and charged the French horsemen
with signal intrepidity. The Greys particularly
distinguished themselves. The <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons,
vying in heroism with the Scots troopers,
overthrew and routed the squadrons opposed to
them; and a sanguinary sword fight ensuing, the
British horsemen made great havoc among the
discomfited ranks of their opponents. Following
up their first success, the Greys, <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>,
and other British dragoons, dashed forward; a
volley from some French musketeers posted on the
low grounds, and behind hedges, emptied several
saddles; but the survivors rushed upon the infantry
and chased them from behind the hedges
and from the low grounds, with dreadful carnage.
While pursuing the fugitives, a new line of combatants
appeared; but, with ranks confused and
blended together, the British dragoons galloped
forward and dispersed these also. This astonishing
gallantry of the British cavalry produced
important results; but the enemy having broken
the centre of the allied army, the Duke of Cumberland
ordered a retreat.</p>

<p>When the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>, and other British
dragoons, faced about to retire, the enemy came
down upon them in crowds, and they sustained
considerable loss. The army retreated to Maestricht,
where it arrived in the evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The casualty-return of the regiment on this
occasion exhibited a serious loss, viz., Lieutenant
Armstrong, Quarter-master Seaman, forty men,
and twenty-two horses wounded; Lieutenant
Gordon, Cornet Hay, seventy-eight men, and
ninety-eight horses killed and missing. The conduct
of the British cavalry on this occasion, was
highly commended in the accounts of the battle
published at the time.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons were subsequently
encamped at Richel, near the Maese, in the province
of Limburg; in October they proceeded to
North Brabant, and pitched their tents behind the
lines at Terheyden; and at the end of the campaign
they went into cantonments among the
Dutch peasantry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1748</div>

<p>A strong remount of men and horses having
joined to replace the losses of the preceding year,
the regiment took the field to serve the campaign
of 1748 in a high state of efficiency, and
according to the publications of that date its
warlike appearance was much admired. It was
employed in the province of Limburg, and was
encamped a short time near Ruremonde. Meanwhile
preliminary articles for a treaty of peace
had been agreed upon; the regiment proceeded
to North Brabant, where it remained a short
time, and during the winter, returned to England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1749</div>

<p>After the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle the establishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
was reduced to two hundred and
eighty-five officers and men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1750</div>

<p>The Earl of Rothes was removed in January,
1750, to the Royal North British dragoons, and
was succeeded in the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>
dragoons by Major-General the Honourable
James Cholmondeley from the Third Irish horse,
now Sixth dragoon guards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1751</div>

<p>In 1751 a regulation was issued for insuring
uniformity in the clothing, standards, and regimental

<p>During the succeeding seven years, the regiment
was employed on home service in Great
Britain, and was distinguished as an efficient and
well-conducted corps.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1755<br />1756</div>

<p>In 1755, when the aggressions of the French
in North America led to acts of open hostility,
the establishment was augmented one corporal
and fifteen men per troop. Shortly afterwards a
<em>light troop</em> was added on the same principle as
light companies to infantry corps: and the regiment
consisted of six heavy troops and one light
troop. The light dragoons were sometimes styled
<em>hussars</em>. A periodical of this date (June, 1756)
has the following paragraph: 'On Monday
morning the newly-raised light horse, or, as
they are commonly called, hussars, were exercised
in Hyde Park, as were also some life
guards and horse grenadiers. The hussars in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
particular made a very pretty and genteel
appearance; went through their peculiar method
of exercise, both on horseback and on foot,
with the greatest vivacity and exactness, to the
satisfaction of many thousands of spectators.'</p>

<p>War was proclaimed, and the French monarch
made such extensive preparations for invading
England, that some alarm was occasioned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1757</div>

<p>These preparations being continued in 1757,
the country was placed in a posture of defence.
Seven battalions were encamped on Barham
Downs under the Duke of Marlborough; five at
Chatham under Lord George Sackville; six at
Amersham under Lieutenant-General Campbell;
a regiment of cavalry and six battalions of infantry
at Dorchester under Sir John Mordaunt; another
camp was formed on the Isle of Wight; and the
<span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons, with the third dragoon
guards, and first, third, fourth, and eleventh
dragoons were encamped on Salisbury plain, under
Lieutenant-General Hawley. The formidable
attitude assumed by the government, with the
increased military power prepared to oppose the
invasion, induced the French monarch to lay
aside his design of landing troops on the British
coast, and he resolved to attack the possessions
of his Britannic Majesty in Hanover.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1758</div>

<p>The increased naval and military establishments
of Britain enabled King George II. to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
assail the coast of France, and an expedition was
prepared for that purpose under the command of
Charles Duke of Marlborough. The light troop
of the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons was selected to
take part in this enterprise, and having been
encamped some time on Southsea Common, and
formed in brigade with the light troops of eight
other regiments, under the command of Brigadier-General
Eliott, (afterwards Lord Heathfield,)
it embarked towards the end of May, 1758, and
sailed for the coast of France on the 1st of June.
On the evening of the 5th a landing was effected
in Cancalle Bay, in the province of Brittany; on
the 7th the troops advanced to Paramé; and
during the following night the light dragoons and
piquets of the infantry regiments proceeded to
the harbour of <em>St. Maloes</em>, and destroyed by fire
one hundred vessels with extensive magazines of
maritime stores. The light cavalry afterwards
advanced to the town of Dol, and evinced signal
intrepidity in skirmishing with detachments of
French troops. After remaining five days in
France the British re-embarked, and severe
weather rendering another descent impracticable,
they returned to Portsmouth. The light troop of
the <span class="smcap">Sixth</span> dragoons having landed, was encamped
a short time at Portsmouth, and subsequently on
Southsea Common. In the beginning of August
it sailed on a second expedition under Lieutenant-General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Bligh. A landing having been effected
in the Bay des Marées, <em>Cherbourg</em> was taken, and
the fortifications and vessels in the harbour were
destroyed. The troops returned on board the
fleet, and another landing was effected in the
bay of St. Lunar; but no advantage resulted
from this enterprise, and before the whole were
re-embarked, the enemy attacked the rear with
such fury that the grenadiers and foot guards
sustained considerable loss. The expedition
returned to England, and the light troop of the
<span class="smcap">Sixth</span> dragoons went into cantonments in villages
along the coast.</p>

<p>Disastrous events had, in the mean time,
occurred in Germany; the Hanoverian, Hessian,
and Brunswick troops commanded by the Duke
of Cumberland, had been subject to a capitulation,
and the electorate of Hanover was taken possession
of by the enemy. The French having
violated the conditions of the capitulation, the
Hanoverians, Hessians, and Brunswickers reassembled
under Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick;
a body of British troops was sent to Germany
under Charles Duke of Marlborough; and the
six heavy troops of the <span class="smcap">Sixth</span> dragoons were
selected for this service. The light troop of the
regiment was left in England on coast duty; and
it was subsequently employed in the travelling
escort duty for the royal family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>The regiment was reviewed on Blackheath by
King George II., who expressed his royal approbation
of its appearance and discipline; it embarked
at Gravesend on the 27th of July; and
landed on the 3rd of August, a few miles above
the city of Embden in Germany, where it encamped
two days, and subsequently marched up
the country to join the Hanoverians, Hessians,
and Brunswickers. The regiment joined the
army at Coesveldt on the 17th of August, and
was reviewed on the 20th, with the other British
corps, by His Serene Highness Prince Ferdinand
of Brunswick, who expressed his admiration of
the condition of the several regiments after the
march. After taking part in the movements of
the army, the regiment went into winter quarters
in the bishopric of Paderborn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1759</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons, commanded by
Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Harvey, took the
field in the spring of 1759, and were formed in brigade
with the Blues and first dragoon guards; the
British were commanded by Lord George Sackville,
and the allied army by Prince Ferdinand of
Brunswick. The French monarch sent an immense
body of troops to Germany, under the
Duke de Broglio and Marshal Contades; and
the allies, being so very inferior in numbers, were
compelled to retire before their opponents.</p>

<p>After a series of retreats and occasional skirmishes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the enemy occupied a strong position
near <em>Minden</em>, and the allied army encamped on
Petershagen heath. Prince Ferdinand advanced,
and having succeeded in drawing the French
from their formidable post, a general engagement
was fought on <em>Minden</em> heath on the 1st of August,
when the astonishing valour of the British infantry
decided the fortune of the day. The British
cavalry were posted behind a wood on the right
of the army, and towards the close of the action
they were ordered forward to charge the French
legions; but a misunderstanding on the part of
Lord George Sackville occasioned some delay;
the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> and other British dragoons, who
were panting for an opportunity to distinguish
themselves, were detained in a state of inactivity,
and the victory was rendered less decisive than
it otherwise would have been. The Marquis of
Granby was afterwards appointed to the command
of the British troops in Germany.</p>

<p>The allied army moved forward in pursuit of
the enemy, whose line of retreat might be traced
by scenes of devastation and the smoke of burning
villages. The <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons formed
part of the division commanded by the Hereditary
Prince of Brunswick, who harassed and attacked
the French during their retreat, occasioning them
serious loss on several occasions; especially at
<em>Grubenhagen</em>, <em>Eimbec</em>, and in the defiles of <em>Minden</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
On the 25th of August the <span class="smcap">Sixth</span> dragoons,
commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel <span class="smcap">Edward Harvey</span>,
arrived, with the remainder of the Hereditary
Prince's division, at Schonstadt. During
the night between the 27th and 28th of August,
the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons, with a detachment
from the first dragoon guards and a battalion
of English grenadiers, commanded by Colonel
Beckwith, marched in the direction of <em>Wetter</em> to
surprise the corps commanded by the celebrated
Colonel <span class="smcap">Frischer</span>, amounting to about two thousand
men, in quarters at that town. <span class="smcap">Frischer's</span>
men were alarmed, and attempted to make resistance,
but the gallant Colonel <span class="smcap">Harvey</span> rushed
upon them at the head of the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>
dragoons, and Beckwith's grenadiers, drawing
their swords, joined in the charge;&mdash;the French
were overthrown; sixty were killed on the spot;
many were wounded; about four hundred were
made prisoners; and the remainder fled in confusion,
towards Marpurg; leaving their camp-equipage,
baggage, and a number of horses in
possession of the conquerors. Lieutenant-Colonel
<span class="smcap">Harvey</span>, of the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons, had a
personal encounter with <span class="smcap">Frischer's</span> brother,
whom he slew with his broadsword; and both
the dragoons and grenadiers distinguished themselves
in a particular manner<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>The pursuit of the French army was continued
a distance of nearly two hundred miles; and
operations were not suspended during the winter.
The weather becoming severe, the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>
dragoons went into cantonments in the villages
near the river Lahn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1760</div>

<p>During the campaign of 1760 the regiment
was formed in brigade with the tenth dragoons
under Major-General the Earl of Pembroke; and,
after much manœuvring and some skirmishing
was encamped at Kalle. At the same time
thirty thousand French troops, commanded by
the Chevalier de Muy, crossed the river Dymel,
and took post at <em>Warbourg</em>, to cut off the communication
of the allies with Westphalia. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons left the camp at Kalle
about eleven o'clock on the night of the 30th of
June, passed the Dymel near Liebenau, and about
five on the following morning were in position
on the heights of Corbeke, from whence they
advanced to a wood within five miles of the
enemy's position. The French were attacked,
and while the action was still raging, the British
cavalry were ordered forward. Traversing the
five miles at a quick pace, they speedily arrived
at the field of battle, and charging the enemy
with signal intrepidity, routed the French cavalry,
put the opposing infantry into disorder, and
chased them across the Dymel. The conduct of
the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons and other British
cavalry regiments was such, that the Marquis of
Granby stated, in his public despatch, that <em>nothing
could exceed their gallant behaviour</em>; Prince Ferdinand
declared in general orders that <em>all the British
cavalry performed prodigies of valour</em>; and an historian
of that date stated, that <em>they outdid all
former examples</em>.</p>

<p>The regiment had only two men and two
horses killed; three men and one horse wounded,
and three horses missing.</p>

<p>The French retired from their camp beyond
the Dymel on the 22nd of August; when the
Hereditary Prince of Brunswick crossed the river
with twelve thousand men to gain the enemy's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
left flank. His leading corps encountered the
enemy's rear-guard near <em>Zierenberg</em>, and a sharp
skirmish ensued. At length the Prince brought
forward the Greys and <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons; a
gallant charge of the two regiments decided the
contest; and the French were driven into the
town.</p>

<p>The French army encamped beyond <em>Zierenberg</em>,
and the volunteers of Clermont and Dauphiné,
amounting to about nine hundred cavalry and a
thousand infantry, were quartered in the town.
After sunset, on the evening of the 5th of September,
the Greys, <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>, and Bock's
dragoons, two regiments of infantry, and one
hundred and fifty Highlanders, crossed the Dymel,
and arriving at Zierenberg before daybreak,
forced the guard and entered the town. A
dreadful slaughter was made of the enemy in the
streets, and a sharp encounter with the bayonet
took place in the churchyard; between three and
four hundred prisoners were captured; also two
pieces of cannon; and at three o'clock the assailants
retired to Warbourg, having lost only ten
men. It was stated in the London Gazette, that
'<em>the behaviour of the officers and the bravery of the
troops, on this occasion, deserve the greatest commendation</em>.'</p>

<p>The Hereditary Prince of Brunswick marched
with a body of troops to the duchy of Cleves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and invested Wesel. The <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons
and several other corps left the camp at
Warbourg, on the 1st of October, under Major-General
Waldegrave, to join the prince, and take
part in the operations on the lower Rhine. The
French, commanded by the Marquis de Castries,
advanced to raise the siege of Wesel, and encamped
half a league behind the convent of
<em>Campen</em>, with Frischer's corps posted within the
convent. The <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons passed the
Rhine by a bridge two miles below Wesel, and
having joined the Hereditary Prince, advanced at
ten o'clock, on the evening of the 15th of
October, to surprise the enemy's camp. It being
necessary to dislodge the troops in the convent,
the firing alarmed the French army, which instantly
formed for battle. The allies having
passed the convent, commenced the action at five
o'clock on the morning of the 16th; and a succession
of charges was continued with varied
success until nine at night, when the Prince
ordered a retreat.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Sixth</span> lost on this occasion two men and
four horses killed; Lieutenant-Colonel Harvey,
Major Hepburn, Cornet Sayer, five men and one
horse wounded; and one man and horse taken by
the enemy.</p>

<p>After repassing the Rhine, the regiment was
encamped at Bounnen, subsequently at Klein<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Reckum, and in December went into cantonments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1761</div>

<p>In February, 1761, the regiment took part in
a successful incursion into the quarters occupied
by the French army; when the allies, advancing
through a heavy snow, drove their opponents before
them many leagues, captured several strong towns
with extensive magazines of forage and provisions,
but were subsequently obliged to retire.</p>

<p>During the campaign of 1761 the regiment
was brigaded with the royals and tenth dragoons,
commanded by Major-General Eliott. It was
employed in several manœuvres, and was in position
in the middle of July, on the rivers Asse
and Lippe in Westphalia, forming part of the
division under the Prince of Anhalt. On the
15th of July, the enemy attacked the Marquis of
Granby's division at <em>Kirch-Denkern</em>, when the
<span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons crossed the Asse river to
support the infantry, and the French were driven
back. The action was renewed on the following
day, and the enemy was again repulsed with
serious loss; but owing to the scene of conflict
being in a thickly-wooded country, interspersed
with marshy ground, the services of the regiment
were limited to supporting the infantry.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Sixth</span> dragoons were subsequently employed
in operations on the Dymel; in November
they were engaged in the electorate of Hanover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
where several sharp skirmishes occurred, in which
they took part, in severe weather, and were sometimes
encamped in the snow. They eventually
went into cantonments in Friesland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1762</div>

<p>Having taken the field to serve the campaign
of 1762, the regiment was formed in brigade with
the fifteenth dragoons, under Colonel Harvey.
After encamping at Brackel in the bishopric of
Paderborn, and subsequently on the heights of
Tissel, the brigade advanced, on the morning of
the 24th of June, with the view of surprising the
French camp at <em>Groebenstien</em>. This movement
was conducted with such address, that the French
were instantly thrown into confusion, and, abandoning
their camp equipage, they fell back upon
Cassel, one division being surrounded and made
prisoners in the woods of <em>Wilhelmsthal</em>. The
<span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons pursued the French towards
Cassel, and afterwards encamped near
Holtzhausen.</p>

<p>In the subsequent operations of the campaign,
the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons were actively employed,
and a series of successes was followed by
the capture of Cassel. A suspension of hostilities
took place in November, and the regiment went
into cantonments in the bishopric of Munster.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1763</div>

<p>A treaty of peace was concluded at Fontainbleau.
The regiment received the thanks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Parliament for its conduct during the war: and
in January, 1763, commenced its march through
Holland to Williamstadt, where it embarked for
England. It landed in February, and was stationed
in South Britain; the <em>light troop</em> was
disbanded; the establishment was reduced to six
troops of twenty-eight private men each, and
eight men per troop were equipped as light
dragoons.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Harvey, who had repeatedly
distinguished himself during the war, was
rewarded with the colonelcy of the twelfth dragoons,
and was succeeded by Major Robert
Rickart Hepburn, a most meritorious officer,
who had served with the regiment many years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1764</div>

<p>After the return of the regiment from Germany,
its head-quarters were established at Northampton;
from whence they were removed, in
1764, to York; at the same time orders were
received for the officers and men to wear epaulettes
on the left shoulder instead of aiguillettes;
the jacked leather boots were directed to be
replaced by others of a lighter description; and
the regiment was directed to be mounted on long-tailed
horses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1765<br />1766</div>

<p>In 1765 the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons occupied
cantonments in Scotland; they returned to England
in the following year, and the head-quarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
were stationed at Coventry, where an order was
received for the drummers on the establishment
to be replaced by trumpeters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1767</div>

<p>The regiment marched into village cantonments,
near London, in May, 1767, and was
reviewed on the 11th of that month, in brigade
with the fourth dragoons, on Wimbledon Common,
by King George III., who was pleased to
express his high approbation of the appearance
and discipline of the two regiments.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1768<br />1769<br />1770</div>

<p>After the review the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons
marched into cantonments in Worcestershire; in
1768 the head-quarters were removed to Lewes;
in 1769 to Ipswich; and in 1770 to York.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771<br />1772<br />1773<br />1774</div>

<p>In the spring of the following year the regiment
proceeded to Scotland; but returned to
England in the beginning of 1772, and was stationed
in Lancashire, the head-quarters being
established at Manchester; from whence they
were removed in 1773 to Worcester, and in 1774
to Canterbury.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1775</div>

<p>A change of quarters took place in the summer
of 1775, and the regiment was stationed in Northamptonshire
and Lincolnshire, with the head-quarters
at Northampton.</p>

<p>On the decease of General Cholmondeley, in
October, 1775, King George III. conferred the
colonelcy on Lieutenant-General Edward Harvey,
who so highly distinguished himself at the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of the regiment in Germany during the seven
years' war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1776<br />1777</div>

<p>In the early part of 1776 the <span class="smcap">Sixth</span> dragoons
commenced their march for Scotland; from
whence they returned in the beginning of 1777,
and were cantoned in Warwickshire and Staffordshire,
the head-quarters being at Coventry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1778</div>

<p>The colonelcy having become vacant by the
decease of General Harvey, it was conferred on
Lieutenant-General James Johnston, from the
first Irish horse, now fourth dragoon guards, by
commission dated the 2nd of April, 1778.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the American war had commenced,
and the French monarch having agreed to aid
the revolted colonies, war was declared against
France. The British army was augmented, and
one hundred men and horses were added to the
<span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons; but the scene of conflict
was so little adapted for cavalry, that the heavy
dragoon regiments were not called upon to quit
the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The head-quarters were removed to Salisbury
in May, 1778; and a further augmentation of
forty-eight men, who were to be mounted on
small horses and equipped as light dragoons, was
added to the regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1779</div>

<p>In April, 1779, the men equipped as light
cavalry were incorporated, with the men of the
third dragoon guards, and first and eleventh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
dragoons, into a regiment, which was numbered
the twentieth light dragoons. During the following
summer, the <span class="smcap">Sixth</span>, and five other regiments
of cavalry, were encamped on Salisbury Plain,
under Lieutenant-General Johnston.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1780<br />1781<br />1782<br />1783</div>

<p>In the two following years the regiment occupied
quarters in Gloucestershire and Worcestershire;
in 1782 it was stationed in Dorsetshire,
with the head-quarters at Dorchester; and in
1783 it was removed into Northamptonshire and
Leicestershire.</p>

<p>The American war had, in the mean time,
terminated, and the establishment was reduced
to two hundred and thirty-two officers and men.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1784<br />1785</div>

<p>During part of the year 1784, the head-quarters
were at Lincoln, with detachments along the
coast; in 1785 they were removed to York, with
detached troops in Northumberland, Durham, and
on the Yorkshire coast.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
1786<br />&nbsp; to<br />1792</div>

<p>In 1786 and 1787 the regiment was stationed
in Lancashire; in 1788 <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'the head-quaters were'">the head-quarters
were</ins> at Exeter, with detachments on the Devonshire
coast; they were removed to Dorchester in
1789; to Winchester in 1790; to Ipswich in
1791; and to York in 1792, with detachments on
coast duty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1793</div>

<p>A revolution had, in the mean time, taken
place in France; and a violent republican party
had seized the reins of government, and imprisoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
their king. These indications of an approaching
war occasioned the establishment of
the regiment to be increased sixty men; in the
beginning of 1793 it was augmented to nine
troops, and was held in constant readiness to proceed
on foreign service; a tenth troop was afterwards
added.</p>

<p>The French republicans, pursuing a career of
cruelty, spoliation, and bloodshed, added to their
multiplied enormities the decapitation of their
king. Infatuated by success in their own land,
they sought to subvert the liberties of other
countries,&mdash;to destroy the civil order of Europe,&mdash;to
spread a moral contamination of principle
and practice which outraged the nature of mankind,&mdash;and
to involve every country in atheism,
despotism, and anarchy. They attacked Holland,
when a British force was sent to the assistance
of the Dutch, and the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons
marched from York in June, 1793,&mdash;embarked at
Blackwall, and having landed at Ostend, went
into quarters for a short time among the Flemish
peasantry.</p>

<p>From Ostend the <span class="smcap">Sixth</span> proceeded to the
vicinity of Bruges, and were formed in brigade
with the blues and royal dragoons. Meanwhile
the successes of the allies had removed the theatre
of the war from Holland, to the frontiers of
French Flanders, and the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
advanced up the country and joined the forces
commanded by the Duke of York before <em>Valenciennes</em>,
which fortress surrendered to His Royal
Highness a few days after the regiment joined the
army.</p>

<p>The British were separated from the remainder
of the allies, with a view of undertaking the
siege of <em>Dunkirk</em>; and the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons
marched from Valenciennes to the vicinity of the
coast for the purpose of forming part of the
covering army. On the evening of the 22nd of
August the French were driven from the camp
at Ghivelde, and the covering forces took up a
defensive position under Marshal Freytag, while
the Duke of York carried on the operations
against the fortress. The delay which took place
in the arrival of the battering train, and of a British
naval force, to co-operate with the army, gave
time for the government of France to assemble
men from various parts, crowd them into coaches,
waggons, and other vehicles, and hurry them day
and night towards Dunkirk. On the 6th of
September the enemy attacked the covering army
with overwhelming numbers, and, owing to the
nature of the ground, the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons
dismounted and formed as infantry. Some sharp
fighting occurred during the day, and after sunset
the covering army withdrew to a new position.
The night was dark and tempestuous; the advance-guard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
took a wrong road, and on entering
the village of <em>Rexpoede</em> it was found to be occupied
by the enemy. Some confused fighting took
place, and Marshal Freytag and Prince Adolphus
were surrounded, but escaped with slight wounds.
Finally the French were repulsed with great
slaughter, and the army, continuing its route,
arrived at Hondschoote on the following morning,
and took up a new position. The <span class="smcap">Sixth</span> dragoons
lost one quarter-master, their sick men, the women,
and the baggage, which fell into the enemy's
hands.</p>

<p>On the 8th of September the covering army
was again attacked, and driven from its ground
by superior numbers; when the Duke of York
raised the siege and retired.</p>

<p>The Dutch posts on the Lys having been
forced on the 12th of September, they abandoned
<em>Menin</em>, which fortress was immediately taken
possession of by the French. The Duke of York
advanced, on the 14th of September, to drive
the enemy across the Lys; and the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>
dragoons formed part of the force under Major-General
Harcourt, which joined the leading column
of Austrians and Hessians under Lieutenant-General
Ehrbach. The French were forced to
evacuate Menin, and were pursued by two British
squadrons and the Austrian hussars towards
Roncq.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>After bivouacking a few days in the fields,
near Menin, the regiment marched to Tournay,
where it was stationed several weeks, and subsequently
passed the severe winter months at
Drongen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1794</div>

<p>Leaving Drongen in February, 1794, the
regiment marched to Oudenarde; in April it
joined the army at Cateau, where it was seen in
marching order by the Emperor Francis; and on
the 17th of that month it supported the column
which attacked and carried the heights of <em>Vaux</em>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons formed part of
the covering army during the siege of <em>Landrécies</em>;
and on the 21st of April, when the enemy attacked
the Prince of Coburg's advanced posts at <em>Blocus</em>,
the regiment formed part of the force which proceeded
to the support of the Austrians; the
French were repulsed at this point; but they succeeded
in driving the Imperialists from Nouvion.</p>

<p>Thirty thousand French, commanded by Lieutenant-General
Chapuy, attacked the Duke of
York's post at <em>Cateau</em> on the 26th of April, and
several cannon shot and shells fell among the
<span class="smcap">Sixth</span> dragoons before they were mounted; but
did little injury. The Duke of York watched
the enemy's movements from the top of a redoubt,
and observing their left uncovered, he detached
a body of troops against that flank; and after a
sharp contest the French general was taken prisoner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and his army driven from the field with
severe loss.</p>

<p>On the 27th of April the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons
were detached to support the troops at
<em>Courtray</em> under General Clairfait, whose advance-posts
at Mourcon were attacked two days afterwards
by the French under General Pichegru,
who carried the post after a severe engagement,
and also gained possession of Courtray. The
<span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons rejoined the army under
the Duke of York.</p>

<p>On the 1st of May the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons
encamped in front of <em>Tournay</em>, with their left to
the road leading towards Lisle, where the army
arrived from the vicinity of Landrécies, and took
up a position to oppose the enemy.</p>

<p>About three o'clock on the morning of the
10th of May a few pistol-shots from the advance-posts
gave indication of an approaching enemy,
and soon afterwards thirty thousand republican
troops appeared in dark masses advancing to
battle. The British soldiers stood to their arms,
and the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons mounted and prepared
for the combat. The report of musketry
with the deep tones of the artillery succeeded,
and the enemy's attempt to turn the left was
repulsed by the fire of the Austrians posted in a
wood. A shower of bullets from the French
artillery assaulted the British centre, and through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the clouds of smoke the opposing columns rushed
to battle. During the conflict several cavalry
corps were detached against the enemy's right
flank. The Queen's Bays, Scots Greys, and
<span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons, forming one superb brigade,
were led forward by the Duke of York, in
open column of half-squadrons; on approaching
the enemy they formed line under a heavy cannonade,
and rushed sword in hand upon their
adversaries. Deep lines, bristled with bayonets,
opposed a formidable resistance; but they were
broken by the terrific charge of the British heavy
cavalry, and the heroic troopers riding furiously
among their adversaries, cut them down with a
terrible carnage. The enemy commenced a
retreat, but was speedily broken and pursued
from the field with great loss.</p>

<p>Three men and seven horses of the <span class="smcap">Sixth</span>
dragoons were killed; seven men and nineteen
horses were wounded, and three horses missing.</p>

<p>A combined attack on the French posts having
been resolved upon, the <span class="smcap">Sixth</span> dragoons joined the
column under General Count Kinsky, who advanced
on the morning of the 17th of May from
Cysoing to the La Marque, and forced the passage
of the river at <em>Bauvines</em>, in which service the
<span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons were engaged; but no
decisive results followed the movements of the
army on this occasion. On the evening of the
same day the regiment joined the Austrians under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Archduke Charles, and advanced on the 18th
to form a junction with the column under the
Duke of York at Roubaix, but was suddenly
ordered to take the route to Tournay, where the
army was again assembled.</p>

<p>The enemy attacked the position with great
fury on the 22nd of May, but was repulsed. The
<span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons were formed in column
on their camp ground; but the French did not
attack that part of the line.</p>

<p>The extraordinary efforts made by the French
government to collect an army of overwhelming
numbers, were eventually attended with complete
success. The Austrians were overthrown and
forced to retreat; the Duke of York was obliged
to withdraw from his position in front of Tournay,
and a series of retrograde movements followed,
during which the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons performed
much severe duty.</p>

<p>After encamping a short period at Rosendael,
the regiment withdrew with the army,
in the early part of August, beyond Breda.
Thirty-five thousand men under the Duke of
York confronted a hundred thousand opponents;
and when the French had made preparations
for enveloping this small body of
British troops, His Royal Highness withdrew
to another post beyond Bois-le-duc, where the
<span class="smcap">Sixth</span> dragoons encamped in the beginning of
September.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Strenuous exertions were made by the allies
for the preservation of Holland; but the Dutch,
having imbibed the revolutionary principles and
doctrines of equality from the French, did not
second these efforts with zeal and energy, and the
British troops were opposed by such immense
masses, that no chance of ultimate success remained.
The Duke of York withdrew beyond
the Maese in the middle of September; and
early in October concentrated his forces about
Nimeguen, through which fortress the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>
dragoons marched a few days before the
place was besieged by the French, and eventually
went into quarters in the villages between
Rhenen and Wyck.</p>

<p>At length a severe frost set in, the rivers
became frozen, so as to admit of an army passing
on the ice, and the advance of the enemy being
facilitated thereby, the prospect of being able to
defend the passage of the Waal became hopeless,
and the regiment was directed to pass the Rhine
and occupy cantonments beyond that river.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1795</div>

<p>In the early part of January, 1795, a sudden
thaw rendering it probable the army would be
enabled to maintain a more forward position and
defend the passage of the Waal, the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>
dragoons were ordered to advance; they repassed
the Rhine on the ice on the 8th of January, and
joined the forces under Major-General Sir David<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Dundas near Geldermalsen. The frost, however,
set in with greater severity than before, the country
was converted into a plain, and after some sharp
fighting the British troops fell back before the
superior numbers of their opponents. The <span class="smcap">Sixth</span>
dragoons withdrew from their forward position;
they were joined by the Queen's Bays, and Scots
Greys, on the 13th of January; harassing marches
over a region of ice and snow followed, and
several men and horses perished from the severity
of the weather.</p>

<p>On the 17th of January the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>
dragoons halted at Campen in Overyssel; on the
26th they were at Steenwyk in the same province,
and continuing this harassing march, they
passed the confines of Holland, and arrived on
the 10th of February at the banks of the Ems, a
river of Westphalia. They were to have halted
at Warmer, but a thaw occasioned them to prosecute
their journey and pass the river on the ice.
Continuing the march on the following day, the
country for a considerable distance was under
water, and several horses which had become
exhausted, were lost in the inundations.</p>

<p>The frost returning, the <span class="smcap">Sixth</span> dragoons countermarched,
repassed the Ems on the ice on the
20th of February, and on the 20th skirmished
with the van of the French army. Several
manœuvres followed, and on the 3rd of March<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
a party of French failed in an attempt to pass the
Ems. On the following day the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>
dragoons had to traverse a small river on the ice
at a point which was commanded by the enemy's
cannon; but the regiment, being favoured by a
very thick fog, passed unperceived by the French.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1796<br />1797</div>

<p>Hostilities terminated in this quarter soon
afterwards; in May the regiment went into cantonments
in villages near the banks of the Weser,
one of the principal rivers in Germany; and in
July it encamped near Delmenhorst, the chief
town of a district of that name in Westphalia,
seven miles south-west of Bremen. On the
breaking up of the camp, the <span class="smcap">Sixth</span> dragoons
marched through Bremen into cantonments on
the right bank of the Weser until November,
when they embarked for England, but were
detained in the river several weeks by contrary
winds. They landed at Yarmouth and South
Shields about Christmas; in January, 1796, they
marched to Norwich, and in September following
to Ipswich, where they passed the succeeding
winter. In the autumn of 1797 they proceeded
to Romford.</p>

<p>General Johnston died on the 13th of December,
1797, and was interred in great state in
Westminster Abbey. He was succeeded in the
colonelcy by George, Earl of Pembroke, K.G.,
who commanded the regiment during the succeeding
thirty years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1798<br />1799<br />1800<br />1801</div>

<p>Leaving Romford in June, 1798, the regiment
proceeded to Windsor, and encamped in the
forest, where a numerous body of troops was
assembled, and exercised in the presence of King
George III. and the royal family. His Majesty
reviewed the regiment; and it afterwards proceeded
into cantonments, the head-quarters being
at Uxbridge. In December, 1799, it marched to
Birmingham; in August, 1800, to Bristol; and
in June, 1801, to Exeter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1802</div>

<p>The successes of the British forces in Egypt
and the West Indies, were followed by a treaty
of peace, in 1802, when the establishment of the
<span class="smcap">Sixth</span> dragoons was reduced to eight troops, and
the total number of officers and men to five hundred
and fifty-three. In October the head-quarters
were removed to Nottingham.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1803</div>

<p>Before the following summer the ambitious
policy of the French republic involved Great
Britain in another war, and the first consul
of France, Napoleon Bonaparte, assembled an
army for the invasion of England. This vain
project was met by formidable preparations on
the part of the British government; an army
of <em>six hundred thousand men</em> (including militia,
yeomanry, volunteers, and troops on foreign
stations) was embodied; and the establishment
of the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons was again augmented.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1804<br />1805</div>

<p>In the summer of 1803 the regiment <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'marched to Birminghan'">marched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
to Birmingham</ins>; in January, 1804, it proceeded
to Brighton, and was stationed near the Sussex
coast during the two following summers, while
the French army lay at Boulogne, on the opposite
side of the channel. In 1805 Napoleon withdrew
his legions from the coast, and marched
against the Russians and Austrians; and in
October the <span class="smcap">Sixth</span> dragoons proceeded to Lewes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1806<br />1807<br />1808<br />1809</div>

<p>The danger of foreign invasion passed away,
the arts, sciences, agriculture, manufactures, and
commerce flourished throughout the British dominions;
while the other countries of Europe
became successively scenes of war, rapine, and
spoliation. The <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons proceeded,
in March, 1806, to Ipswich; during the
winter of 1807 to York, and in the summer of 1808
they marched to Scotland, and occupied Piershill
barracks, Edinburgh. In June, 1809, they embarked
at Portpatrick for Ireland; they landed
at Donaghadee, and marched to Dundalk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810<br />1811<br />1813<br />1814</div>

<p>While the British troops were triumphant
over the legions of Napoleon, in Portugal, Spain,
and the south of France, the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons
were detained on home service in Ireland.
In the summer of 1810 they marched to Dublin;
in November, 1811, to Ballinasloe; in March,
1813, to Belturbet; in May following, to Tullamore,
and in April, 1814, to Dublin, from whence
they embarked for Liverpool, where they arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
on the 3rd of May, and proceeding to York,
halted there three months, and afterwards marched
to Nottingham.</p>

<p>While the regiment was in Ireland, the cocked
hats and feathers were replaced by brass helmets,
and the high boots and breeches by cloth trousers
and short boots.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the victories of the British army
had been followed by the removal of Napoleon
from the throne of France, and the re-establishment
of tranquillity in Europe: the numbers of
the regiment were consequently reduced from ten
to eight troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815</div>

<p>The return of peace was followed by public
rejoicings throughout the country; but scarcely
had these subsided, when news arrived of the
return of Bonaparte to France; of the flight of
Louis XVIII. from the capital; and of the re-assumption
of the imperial dignity by the usurper.
Preparations for war immediately commenced;
the establishment of the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons
was augmented, and six troops, mustering four
hundred and fifty officers and men, under the
command of Colonel Joseph Muter, were selected
to proceed on foreign service; the depôt troops
commanded by Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel Ellice,
were stationed at Ipswich.</p>

<p class="right">[To face page 80.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The six troops destined for service abroad proceeded,
in April, 1815, to Gravesend, where they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>embarked for Ostend; some delay was occasioned
by contrary winds; but the whole reached Flanders
in safety, and on the first of May they were in
quarters beyond Bruges, from whence they removed
a few stages further up the country. A
British, Hanoverian, and Brunswick force was
assembled in Belgium under Field-Marshal His
Grace the Duke of Wellington, and the King of
the Netherlands placed his troops under the
orders of the British commander. The <span class="smcap">Sixth</span>
were formed in brigade with the royal dragoons
and Scots greys, commanded by Major-General
Sir William Ponsonby, K.C.B. They were reviewed
by the Prince of Orange, and Lieutenant-General
the Earl of Uxbridge, commanding the
cavalry, on the 24th of May; and on the 29th of
that month they were seen, together with the
other cavalry corps and the royal horse artillery,
by the Duke of Wellington, who was accompanied
by Marshal Von Blucher, the commander
of the Prussian army.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons reposed in cantonments
among the Belgic peasantry about six
weeks; being stimulated by the fame acquired by
several corps in the Peninsular campaigns, from
1808 to 1814, they were eager for an opportunity
to signalize their intrepidity and prowess against
the enemies of their country, and this opportunity
was soon afforded them. About four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
o'clock on the morning of the 16th of June, they
were suddenly aroused by the notes of the bugle
summoning them to assemble, mounted, at the
alarm posts. Springing from their beds with
alacrity, they were speedily equipped, and, as the
Belgic husbandmen commenced their labours in
the field, the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons were seen
directing their march towards <em>Quatre Bras</em>, where
the French divisions, under Marshal Ney, had
suddenly attacked the advance-posts, while Bonaparte
assailed the Prussians at Ligny with the
main body of his army. Continuing its route by
Enghien, Brain-le-Conte, and Nivelles, the regiment
arrived at the scene of conflict a little
before midnight; the hostile forces were reposing
on their arms; and the <span class="smcap">Sixth</span> bivouacked behind
the position, in a corn-field on the left of the
road from Charleroi to Brussels.</p>

<p>The Prussians having retreated, the Duke of
Wellington made a corresponding movement, and
the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons were employed in
covering the retreat of the infantry and artillery
to the position of Mont St. Jean, in front of the
village of <em>Waterloo</em>. On passing through Genappe,
a heavy thunder-storm deluged the country
and put a stop to the firing; but as the atmosphere
cleared, the scene became particularly
interesting; the cavalry brigades were manœuvring
in the face of the adverse army; the loud tones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of the artillery, the fire of skirmishers in the
fields, the seventh hussars and first life guards
charging the French lancers in the streets, while
Bonaparte urged forward his numerous squadrons,
thinking to overwhelm the British horsemen, presented
to the eye an animating and splendid spectacle.
On arriving at the heights of Mont St.
Jean, an opposition was presented to the French
emperor, which he despaired to overcome that
evening, and the hostile forces confronted each
other during the night, the men and horses being
exposed to a continual rain.</p>

<p>On the morning of the memorable 18th of
June, the army appeared in order of battle. The
Royals, Greys, and <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons, were
formed on the left of the road leading from Brussels
to Charleroi, to support Lieutenant-General
Sir Thomas Picton's division of infantry, which
crowned the heights in front of the brigade. At
ten o'clock the French appeared on the opposite
heights, from whence a cloud of skirmishers was
sent forward; the artillery gradually opened its
fire, and about noon the enemy's columns traversed
the intervening space, and one of the most
sanguinary, hard-contested, and important battles
recorded in the annals of war commenced: a
battle in which the fate of kingdoms, and the
destiny of millions, was decided by British skill,
and by British valour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>After failing in reiterated assaults on the post
of Hugomont, simultaneous attacks were formed;
one of cuirassiers against the centre, which was
defeated by the British household cavalry; and
one of infantry against the left of the position
occupied by the allied army. The formation of
columns was partly concealed by the nature of
the ground; but the glistening of bayonets was
seen at intervals, above the undulations which
form the features of this sanguinary field.</p>

<p>Twenty thousand infantry appeared on the
heights opposite the spot where the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>
dragoons were formed, and rushing forward with
that eager velocity which characterizes the first
attack of French soldiers, they traversed the
intervening space with astonishing expedition,
dispersed a Belgic brigade with which they first
came in contact, broke through parts of the
British supporting infantry, and ascended the
position occupied by the allied army. A <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'favourable oppportunity'">favourable
opportunity</ins> for the Royals, Greys, and <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>
dragoons to charge presented itself;
the Earl of Uxbridge galloped up to the three
regiments, and they instantly deployed and advanced
against the dark masses of the enemy.
A spirit of emulation, and a thirst for glory,
beamed in the countenances of the officers and
men, as they moved forward in firm array, presenting
a noble spectacle of nine squadrons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
superb heavy cavalry, whose warlike appearance
and resolute bearing excited admiration. The
French columns were urging forward with rapid
steps as to certain victory; crowds of infantry
and artillery fled before them; and as they ascended
the crest of the position, they presented
a menacing and alarming aspect. An important
crisis in the battle had arrived, and stupendous
results depended on the valour of the Royals,
Greys, and <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons. The three
regiments advanced steadily to meet these numerous
and formidable bands of opponents, who
were concealed from their view by the rising
ground: they paused a short time to permit the
retreating infantry and artillery to pass through
the intervals of squadrons, and the next moment
these powerful horsemen raised a loud and terrific
shout, and rushed furiously upon the adverse
ranks of war. The spectacle was grand, and the
result glorious to the British arms. The French
masses being unable to deploy, the heads of
columns were instantly broken and forced back;
confusion ensued, the firing ceased, a general
flight commenced, and as the smoke cleared away
the British dragoons were seen plunging their
horses into the midst of the broken columns, and
cutting down the French musketeers with a
terrible carnage, until the slope of the position
was literally covered with slain. Crowds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
French soldiers threw down their arms and surrendered;
while others cast themselves on the
ground to escape the victorious troopers. The
Royals and Greys took each an eagle: the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>
dragoons cut off from their own lines
and made prisoners a numerous body of French
infantry, with whom part of the regiment was
detached to the rear. The brigade continued its
victorious course, spreading terror, carnage, and
dismay over the field: it crossed the ravine,
carried several batteries, and penetrated to the
rear of the enemy's position. Pursuing their
opponents too far, the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons were,
on returning, charged by a numerous body of the
enemy's lancers, and sustained considerable loss.</p>

<p>Major-General Sir William Ponsonby having
been killed by the lancers, the command of the
brigade devolved on Colonel Muter of the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>
dragoons; and that of the regiment on
Lieutenant-Colonel Fiennes Miller, who had previously
had his horse killed under him, and had
received several bayonet wounds, but having had
his wounds dressed, and procuring a horse which
had belonged to a French officer of lancers, he
kept his post at the head of the regiment.</p>

<p>The brigade having re-formed, was stationed
behind a little wood, where it remained, protected
from the enemy's incessant fire of shot
and shells by some high ground and by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
trees, until about four o'clock in the afternoon,
when it was ordered to the right of the position,
and there suffered severely from a heavy cannonade.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Miller was again wounded
about five o'clock, and withdrew, leaving the
regiment under the command of Captain Madox.
About half-past five Colonel Muter was wounded,
and the command of the brigade devolved on
Lieutenant-Colonel Clifton, of the royal dragoons.</p>

<p>In the general attack made on the French army
at the close of the day, the brigade had another
opportunity of distinguishing itself, and, although
it was reduced to a very small number of officers
and men by casualties and parties detached to
the rear with prisoners, yet it proved victorious
over every description of force which opposed its
advance. The French army sustained a decisive
overthrow. The troops under the Duke of
Wellington halted on the field, surrounded by
cannon and other trophies of victory, while the
Prussians, who had arrived at the close of the
action, pursued Bonaparte's discomfited legions
throughout the night.</p>

<p>Thus ended a battle, the greatest of past or
present times, the character and importance of
which may be estimated by the splendid results,
and by the continued peace which has followed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
The brigade, of which the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons
formed part, was commended by the Duke of
Wellington in his public despatch.</p>

<p>The regiment had Lieutenant and Adjutant
Clusky, two troop-serjeant-majors, three serjeants,
four corporals, one trumpeter, seventy-five privates,
and one hundred and sixty-four horses
killed; Colonel Muter, Lieutenant-Colonel Miller,
Captains W. F. Browne, and the Honourable S.
Douglas, Lieutenant Hassard, and Cornet Ruffo,
three serjeant-majors, six serjeants, five corporals,
two trumpeters, eighty-five men, and twenty-seven
horses wounded.</p>

<p>Colonel Muter and Lieutenant-Colonel Miller
had the honour of receiving the riband and
badge of companion of the order of the Bath.
Colonel Muter was further rewarded with the
decoration of the fourth class of St. Wladimir of
Russia, Captain Madox was promoted to the
rank of major in the army.</p>

<p>Serjeant-Majors William Seney, John Laws,
and Matthew Marshall, Serjeants Hugh M'Mahon,
and Johnston Marlow, with Privates William Penfold
and Robert Potters, particularly distinguished
themselves.</p>

<p>Every officer and soldier present at this
engagement received a silver medal; and the
subaltern officers, with the non-commissioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
officers and privates, were allowed to reckon two
years' service for that battle<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>.</p>

<p>The royal authority was also given for the
regiment to bear the word "<span class="smcap">Waterloo</span>" on its
guidons and appointments.</p>

<p>The regiment advanced in pursuit of the
wreck of the French army on the following day;
on the 22nd of June it bivouacked at Malplaquet,
a village which is celebrated in history as the
scene of a desperate engagement, on the 11th of
September, 1709, when the army commanded by
the Duke of Marlborough gained a victory over
the French under Marshals Villars and Boufflers.</p>

<p>Continuing the pursuit of the French army,
the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons arrived, in the beginning
of July, at the vicinity of Paris, and after
the surrender of the capital, they went into quarters
at the village of Nanterre, where they
remained three weeks, and subsequently marched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
to Rouen. They took part in several reviews of
the army commanded by the Duke of Wellington,
at which the sovereigns of Russia, Austria,
Prussia, and France, were present.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1816</div>

<p>The war having terminated with the restoration
of the Bourbon dynasty to the throne of
France, and the conclusion of a treaty of peace,
the regiment marched to Calais. It embarked
for England on the 1st of January, 1816, and
after landing at Dover, proceeded to Salisbury,
and subsequently to Exeter. At the same time its
numbers were reduced to a peace establishment.</p>

at Donaghadee on the 1st of July,
and marched into quarters at Gort, in the county
of Galway.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1820<br />1821</div>

visit of His Majesty King George IV. to
this part of his dominions. In August the regiment

Sir George Pownall Adams,
K.C.H., by commission dated the 26th of October,

<div class="sidenote">1841</div>

<p>The regiment proceeded to Dublin in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>

the head-quarters were afterwards established at
Birmingham.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1842</div>

<p>In May, 1842, the regiment commenced its
march for Scotland, and was quartered at Glasgow
and Edinburgh; the whole assembling at Edinburgh
in August.</p>

<p>On the visit of <span class="smcap">Queen Victoria</span> to Scotland
in September of this year, the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons
had the honour to receive Her Majesty on
landing at Granton Pier, and to furnish guards of
honour, and all the Royal escorts at Edinburgh,
and as far as Perth, on Her Majesty's journey to
the north of Scotland. The regiment also
attended the Queen to Granton Pier, when Her
Majesty re-embarked for London on the 15th of
September.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1843</div>

<p>Routes were received in the spring of 1843,
for the regiment to march to England, when the
following general order was issued, dated</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">"<em>Edinburgh, April 1, 1843.</em></p>

<p>"Major-General Sir Neil Douglas cannot
permit the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons to quit the
North British district without expressing to
Lieutenant-Colonel White, the officers, non-commissioned
officers, and soldiers of that regiment,
his perfect satisfaction with their conduct
during the time they have been under his
command. It appears very evident that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
exertions of the officers have succeeded in
instilling into the minds of their men, that,
next to distinguished valour in the field, nothing
can more fully establish the character of a
British soldier than quiet, peaceable, and subordinate
behaviour in quarters, which the <span class="smcap">Sixth</span>
dragoons have so eminently displayed while
stationed in North Britain. Nor can the
Major-General forget the manner in which the
regiment performed the honorable duties assigned
to it during Her Majesty's visit to her
northern dominions, which called forth approbation
from the highest authorities. In taking
leave of the regiment the Major-General begs
to assure the officers, non-commissioned officers,
and men of the <span class="smcap">Sixth</span> dragoons, that they carry
with them his sincere and hearty wishes for
their prosperity and honour, wherever their
country may require their services.</p>

<p>On arriving in England the head-quarters of
the regiment were established at Leeds; in
October the regiment marched from that station
to Nottingham.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1844<br />1845</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Sixth, or the Inniskilling Regiment

liberty, as established by law, at a period of
peculiar difficulty and danger, such as seldom
has been witnessed in the United Kingdom;
and their heroic gallantry ensured to their country
the blessings of constitutional monarchy.
Loyalty, courage and obedience, have been
evinced by the officers and soldiers of the regiment
from that period to the present time;
and whether in the war of the Austrian succession,&mdash;in
the seven years' war in Germany,&mdash;the
early campaigns of the war of the French
revolution,&mdash;or on the memorable field of <span class="smcap">Waterloo</span>,
the same valour and constancy have
been displayed, which shone so brilliantly in
the first members of the corps. Being equally
conspicuous for good conduct on home service,
the regiment has always possessed the confidence,
and ranked high in the estimation, of the sovereign
and of the country.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Sir Albert Cunningham.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 31st December, 1689.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Albert Cunningham</span> is represented by historians
as a gentleman of great personal merit. He
held a commission in the army in Ireland, and was
appointed lieutenant-general of the Ordnance in that
country; but he was removed from his appointment
by King James II., for his stedfast adherence to
the established institutions of his country. His
cordial co-operation with the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> men in
the defence of their civil and religious liberties, occasioned
him to be commissioned by King William III.
to raise from among their numbers a corps of dragoons,
now the <span class="smcap">Sixth</span>, or the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> Regiment.
He evinced distinguished courage and ability
at the head of his regiment in several battles and
skirmishes in Ireland; and was killed by an Irish serjeant
in King James's service, after having been taken
prisoner at Coloony, near Sligo, in September, 1691,
as narrated at <a href="#Page_30">page 30</a>, in the Record of the <span class="smcap">Sixth</span>
Dragoons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Robert Echlin.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 30th December, 1691.</em></p>

<p>This officer held the commission of lieutenant-colonel
in the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons, and was so
conspicuous for personal bravery, attention to duty,
and devotion to the principles of the Revolution of
1688, that after the death of Sir Albert Cunningham,
King William III. promoted him to the colonelcy of
the regiment. He was advanced to the rank of
brigadier-general in 1703; to that of major-general in
1704; and of lieutenant-general in 1707. A change in
the political sentiments of Lieutenant-General Echlin
appears to have taken place towards the close of Queen
Anne's reign, and soon after the accession of King
George I. he was required to dispose of his commission
of colonel of the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">John Earl of Stair, K.T.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 4th March, 1715.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord John Dalrymple</span> served as a volunteer
under King William III., in Flanders, and was with the
Cameronian regiment (twenty-sixth foot) at the battle
of Steinkirk, in 1692. Immediately before the decease
of His Majesty, he was nominated lieutenant-colonel
of the Scots foot-guards, and his commission was one
of the first signed by Queen Anne after her accession.
He served as aide-de-camp to the Earl of Marlborough
during the campaign of 1702, and in the following
year he obtained the colonelcy of a Dutch regiment,
which he exchanged, on the 1st of January, 1706, with
Colonel James Borthwick, of the Cameronian regiment.
In the same year he obtained the rank of brigadier-general;
served in that capacity at the battle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Ramilies; and in August he was promoted to the
colonelcy of the Scots Greys. On the decease of his
father, in January, 1707, he succeeded to the title of
<span class="smcap">Earl of Stair</span>. He commanded a brigade at the
battle of Oudenarde, in 1708; and was sent to England
with the news of that victory.</p>

<p>Having been appointed major-general on the 1st of
January, 1709, he served in that capacity at the battle
of Malplaquet; and was advanced to the rank of
lieutenant-general on the 1st of January, 1710. He
passed the winter of 1709-10 in Poland, as envoy
extraordinary to that court; but returning to the army
in the spring, he served at the siege of Douay, and was
honoured in the same year with the order of the
Thistle. He was promoted to the rank of general on
the 5th of April, 1712, and afterwards served in Flanders
under the Duke of Ormond; but having subsequently
opposed the ministry, he was ordered to sell the
colonelcy of his regiment to the Earl of Portmore.</p>

<p>Shortly after his accession to the throne, King
George I. appointed the Earl of Stair, one of the lords
of the bedchamber, a member of the privy council, and
commander-in-chief in Scotland in the absence of the
Duke of Argyle; and in the following spring conferred
upon his Lordship the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>
dragoons. In the same year he was sent to
France in a diplomatic character, and afterwards displayed
great abilities as ambassador extraordinary at that
court, from which he was recalled in 1720. In 1729 he
had the appointment of vice-admiral of Scotland; but
having joined the opposition against Sir Robert
Walpole, his lordship was removed in 1733 from that
post, and in the following year from the colonelcy of
the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons.</p>

<p>After his return from France, in 1720, the active
mind of the Earl of Stair was turned to agricultural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
improvements; but on the dissolution of the Walpole
administration, in 1742, his lordship was called from
his retirement, appointed governor of Minorca, field-marshal
of the forces, and commander-in-chief of the
troops sent to Flanders; also ambassador extraordinary
and plenipotentiary to the States General of Holland.
In April, 1743, he was restored to the colonelcy of the
<span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons; and he commanded the
British troops on the continent during the early part of
the campaign of that year. He also commanded,
under King George II., at the battle of Dettingen;
but, observing that His Majesty gave preference to the
advice of the Hanoverian generals, he shortly afterwards
obtained permission to resign.</p>

<p>In 1744 the Earl of Stair was appointed commander-in-chief
in Great Britain. After the death of
his gallant brother-in-law, Sir James Campbell, who
fell at Fontenoy, the colonelcy of the Scots Greys was
again conferred upon his lordship, and he was appointed
general of the marine forces in 1746. He
died in 1747.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Charles Lord Cadogan.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 19th June, 1734.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Cadogan</span> entered the army in 1706, and
served in Flanders under the celebrated John Duke of
Marlborough. He was a member of parliament for
the borough of Reading, also for Newport, in Hampshire.
In 1715 he was appointed captain and lieutenant-colonel
in the second foot-guards; and in 1719
he purchased the colonelcy of the King's own regiment
of foot. He succeeded, on the decease of his brother,
the celebrated William Earl Cadogan, in 1726, to the
dignity of <span class="smcap">Lord Cadogan</span>, Baron of Oakley; and in
1734 he was removed to the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
In 1739 he was promoted to the rank of major-general;
in 1742 he was appointed colonel of the second troop
of life guards, which gave him the privilege of taking
the court duty of Gold Stick; and in 1745 he was promoted
to the rank of lieutenant-general. The government
of Sheerness was conferred upon his lordship in
1749, that of Gravesend and Tilbury in 1752, and in
1761 he was promoted to the rank of general. His
lordship was a fellow of the Royal Society, and one of
the trustees of the British Museum. He died in 1776.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">John Earl of Rothes.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 29th May, 1745.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord John Leslie</span> was appointed to the captaincy
of a troop of dragoons in 1715, and in 1717 he
obtained the command of a company in the foot guards.
Two years afterwards he was appointed to the lieut.-colonelcy
of the Royal North British Fusiliers. On the
decease of his father, in 1722, he succeeded to the title
of <span class="smcap">Earl of Rothes</span>, and was appointed governor of
Stirling castle. He obtained the colonelcy of the
twenty-fifth regiment in May, 1732, and the rank of
brigadier-general in 1739. In 1742 he proceeded with
the forces under the Earl of Stair to Flanders; was
appointed major-general on the 1st of January, 1743,
and served in that capacity at the head of the second
line of infantry at the battle of Dettingen. In April,
1745, he was removed to the colonelcy of the Scots
horse grenadier guards, and in the following month to
the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons. His lordship distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
himself at the head of a brigade of cavalry at
the battle of Roucoux in 1746; was advanced to the
rank of lieutenant-general in 1747; and, in 1750, obtained
the colonelcy of the Scots Greys. In the succeeding
year he was appointed governor of Duncannon
fort, and lieutenant-general on the staff of Ireland; and
in April, 1752, he was removed to the colonelcy of the
third, or Scots, foot guards. He was constituted a
Knight of the Thistle in 1753; and obtained the rank
of general in 1765. He died on the 10th of December,
1767.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">The Honourable James Cholmondeley.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 16th January, 1750.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Honourable James Cholmondeley</span>, third
son of George, second Earl of Cholmondeley, was
appointed guidon and major in the first troop (now
first regiment) of life guards on the 12th of May, 1725;
in 1731 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant and
lieutenant-colonel in the third troop of life guards; and
in January, 1741, King George II. conferred upon him
the colonelcy of a newly-raised regiment, then numbered
the fifty-ninth, and now the forty-eighth foot;
from which he was removed in December, 1742, to the
colonelcy of the thirty-fourth regiment. In 1744 he
proceeded with his regiment to Flanders, and served
the campaign of that year with the allied army under
Field-Marshal Wade. He was at the battle of Fontenoy
on the 11th of May, 1745, and on the 8th of the
following month he was appointed brigadier-general, in
which capacity he served the remainder of that campaign.
On the breaking out of the rebellion in Scotland,
in the winter of the same year, he was ordered to
England, with a brigade of infantry, and after his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
arrival he was sent to Chester to take command of two
battalions which had recently arrived from Ireland, with
which he joined the army commanded by Field-Marshal
Wade, in Yorkshire. After the flight of the rebels from
Derby, he was detached to Scotland, where he served
under Lieutenant-General Hawley, and signalized himself
in a most conspicuous manner at the battle of
Falkirk, on the 17th of January, 1746; but the excessive
fatigue he underwent, with continued exposure to
severe weather, deprived him of the use of his limbs
for some time. On the 23rd of September, 1747, he
was promoted to the rank of major-general; on the
24th of July, 1749, he was removed to the twelfth
dragoons; and in November of the same year to the
third Irish horse, now sixth dragoon guards. He was
again removed on the 16th of January, 1750, to the
<span class="smcap">Sixth</span> dragoons; and on the 2nd of May, 1754, he was
promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general. He was
many years lieutenant-governor of Chester; and died on
the 13th of October, 1775.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Edward Harvey.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 18th October, 1775.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward Harvey</span> was many years an officer of
the <span class="smcap">Sixth</span>, or <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> regiment of dragoons,
with which corps he served at the battles of Dettingen,
Fontenoy, Roucoux, and Val. On the 29th of May,
1754, he was promoted to the lieutenant-colonelcy of the
regiment; and under his care and attention to all the
duties of commanding officer, the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons
became celebrated as a corps of heavy cavalry.
Proceeding with his regiment to Germany, in the
summer of 1758, he was present at nearly every action
during the remainder of the seven years' war, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
twice wounded, viz., at Wetter, in August, 1759, where
he highly distinguished himself, and at Campen, in
October, 1760. He commanded a brigade of cavalry
during the summer of 1762, and was highly commended
for his signal gallantry and ability at the dislodging of
a French corps from Homburg in August of that year,
when he led the Blues to the charge in gallant style,
and overthrew all opposition. On the 17th of March,
1763, King George III. promoted him to the colonelcy
of the twelfth dragoons, and in the following year he
was removed to the third Irish horse, or carabineers.
He was promoted to the rank of major-general in 1762,
and to that of lieutenant-general in 1772. He performed
the duties of adjutant-general of the forces
several years, to which appointment he was nominated
by King George III. soon after the termination of the
seven years' war. On the decease of General Cholmondeley,
His Majesty gave him the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span>
dragoons, with which corps his early services
were connected. He died in 1778.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">James Johnston.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 2nd April, 1778.</em></p>

<p>This officer obtained the commission of cornet in
the thirteenth dragoons on the 5th of October, 1736,
and was removed to the royal dragoons in 1739, in
which corps he rose to the rank of major, and was
promoted to the lieutenant-colonelcy of the thirteenth
dragoons on the 2nd of December, 1754. In April,
1759, he was re-appointed to the first royal dragoons,
and proceeding in command of the regiment to Germany,
served in the battles and skirmishes of that and
the two succeeding campaigns under Prince Ferdinand
of Brunswick. He particularly distinguished himself
at the battle of Warbourg, and was wounded at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
battle of Campen. In 1762 he was promoted to the
local rank of major-general in Germany, and he commanded
a brigade of cavalry during the campaign of
that year. He was distinguished alike for the sterner
military virtues,&mdash;for a gentlemanly deportment,&mdash;and
an amiable disposition, which procured him the esteem
of all ranks; and on the breaking up of the army on
the continent he received a flattering mark of the
approbation of the hereditary Prince of Brunswick,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>&mdash;namely,
a valuable gold snuff-box embellished with
highly-chased military trophies, accompanied by an
autograph letter from the prince. His services were
rewarded with the appointment of lieutenant-governor
of the island of Minorca in 1763, and he was promoted
to the rank of major-general in 1770. In the following
year this meritorious officer was rewarded with the
colonelcy of the ninth dragoons; in 1774 he was constituted
governor of Quebec; and in 1775 he obtained
the colonelcy of the first Irish horse (now fourth dragoon
guards). Two years afterwards he was promoted to
the rank of lieutenant-general; in 1778 he was removed
from the first Irish horse to the <span class="smcap">Sixth Inniskilling</span>
dragoons; and was further promoted to the rank of
general in 1793: he is stated to have been one of the
most celebrated swordsmen of his time. The decease
of this distinguished veteran occurred on the 13th of
December, 1797, at Hampton, from whence he was
removed with great state for interment in Westminster
Abbey on the 21st of that month.</p>

army on the 10th of September, 1775, as ensign in the
twelfth foot, then stationed at Gibraltar, and obtained
the rank of lieutenant in 1777. In January, 1778, he
obtained a company in the seventy-fifth, or Prince of
Wales's regiment of foot, then being raised, and in
December following he was removed to the royal regiment
of dragoons. In 1781 he was appointed major of
the twenty-second light dragoons, and in the following
year he was promoted to the lieutenant-colonelcy of the
second dragoon guards.</p>

<p>In 1793 he proceeded with his regiment to Flanders,
and soon after his arrival, he was detached by the Duke
of York, with the second and third dragoon guards, to
join the Prussians. Having united the two regiments
with Lieutenant-General Count Hohenzollern's corps,
he was employed in covering the left flank of the
Prussian army during the siege of Valenciennes, in
which service he was several times engaged in skirmishes
with the French, and evinced signal ardour and
gallantry. He subsequently rejoined the Duke of York's
army, and was employed in covering the siege of Dunkirk;
having under his command four British and
Hanoverian squadrons and four pieces of flying artillery,
he dislodged a body of French from Hundschuyt.
His lordship was principally employed in the out-post
duty during the remainder of the campaign.</p>

<p>On the decease of his father, in January, 1794, he
succeeded to the dignity of <span class="smcap">Earl of Pembroke and
Montgomery</span>. In 1795 he was promoted to the rank
of major-general, and was employed, in 1797, on the
staff under General Sir Charles (afterwards Earl) Grey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>

of the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons. He commanded the
south-west district in 1779, was promoted to the rank
of lieutenant-general in 1802, and was invested with
the order of the Garter in 1805. In 1807 he was
sent on a special embassy to Vienna. His lordship was
also appointed governor of Guernsey in the same year;
and in 1812 he was promoted to the rank of general.
He died on the 26th of October, 1827.</p>

light dragoons on the 2nd of March, 1797; in 1801 he
was appointed major in the same corps. In the years
1804 and 1805 he studied in the Royal Military College,
High Wycombe, and on his examination he obtained
a diploma of the first qualification. He was appointed
to the staff of the Duke of Gloucester at the same
period, and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel
in 1808. In February, 1810, he embarked for
Portugal with his regiment, with which he served three
campaigns in the Peninsula, and was present at the
several actions in which his regiment took part during
that period. He commanded the thirteenth light dragoons
at the gallant affair at Arroyo dos Molinos on the
28th of October, 1811, and was commended in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>

the lieutenant-colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Sixth</span> dragoons, and

He commanded the <span class="smcap">Inniskilling</span> dragoons at the
battle of <span class="smcap">Waterloo</span>, until the fall of the gallant
Major-General Sir William Ponsonby, when the command
of the brigade, consisting of the first, second, and
sixth dragoons, devolved on Colonel Muter. This

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
